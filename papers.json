        "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-026-40876-x",
        "abstract": "We investigate the transition processes between the emitting (ON) and non-emitting (OFF) states of fluorescent molecules using a machine-learning approach. In fluorescently labeled DNA, continuous fluorescence is observed under irradiation; however, the system occasionally transitions to a non-emitting state, often associated with a charge-separated configuration. The resulting fluorescence trajectories exhibit characteristic blinking behavior —alternating ON and OFF states— which is heavily obscured by various sources of noise, making reliable state classification challenging. Because such trajectories represent typical stochastic time-series data, advanced analytical techniques are required. In this study, we apply a hidden Markov model to extract hidden ON/OFF states from noisy fluorescence trajectories using the forward-filtered backward-blocking Gibbs sampling algorithm, and construct probability density functions of the ON- and OFF-state durations to characterize the blinking dynamics. From these distributions, the characteristic relaxation times are evaluated as 17.6 ms for the ON state and 7.8 ms for the OFF state. The relatively long OFF period indicates that the charge-separated state in the DNA-ATTO655 system is fairly stable, suggesting suppressed charge recombination. In addition, we discuss the characteristic timescale of the light absorption–emission process in the ON state in terms of the average photon count per time bin. These results provide new insights into the fluorescence dynamics of single DNA-fluorophore systems. Finally, we discuss the detailed conditions required for reliable time-series analysis in terms of the photon-count histogram shape and the time-bin width used in the trajectories.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) constitute the fundamental building blocks of cellular machinery, orchestrating complex biological processes from signal transduction to metabolic regulation. Despite significant advances in computational biology, existing methods face critical limitations in capturing the quantum mechanical nature of molecular interactions and the intricate dynamics of protein networks. This work introduces a groundbreaking Quantum-based Graph Differential Model (QGDM) that synergistically combines quantum superposition principles with differential geometry to model PPI networks with unprecedented accuracy. Our innovative framework incorporates quantum state representations of protein conformations, quantum entanglement effects in binding sites, and novel differential operators on protein interaction graphs to capture temporal dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation on five major datasets (STRING, BioGRID, IntAct, HIPPIE, and DIP), QGDM achieves exceptional performance with 96.7% accuracy, 95.8% precision, and 94.3% recall, representing improvements of 15.2%, 13.9%, and 16.1% respectively over state-of-the-art methods. Our model successfully identified 1247 novel PPIs in the human interactome, with experimental validation confirming 91.8% accuracy through yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The quantum differential framework provides revolutionary insights into the probabilistic nature of protein interactions and establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding cellular network dynamics through quantum mechanical principles. This work opens new frontiers in computational biology, offering transformative capabilities for drug discovery, disease mechanism elucidation, and personalized medicine applications.",

        "abstract": "Navigation up a sensory gradient is one of the simplest behaviours, and the simplest strategy is run and tumble. But some organisms use other strategies, such as reversing direction or turning by some angle. Here we ask what drives the choice of strategy, which we frame as maximising up-gradient speed using a given amount of sensory information per unit time. We find that, without directional information on which way to turn, behavioural strategies which make sudden turns perform better than gradual steering. We see various transitions where a different strategy becomes optimal, such as a switch from reversing direction to fully re-orienting tumbles as more information becomes available. And, among more complex re-orientation strategies, we show that discrete turn angles are best, and see transitions in how many such angles the optimal strategy employs.",

        "abstract": "It is well established that dilute active dopants can melt an arrested amorphous solid by enhancing cage breaking and accelerating structural relaxation. Yet it remains unclear whether increasing persistence simply amplifies this effective melting or instead reorganizes the fluidization mechanism itself. Here we show that, in a minimal active-passive mixture, increasing persistence drives a crossover from homogeneous fluidization to a localized mechanical instability, demonstrating that sustained active forcing restructures relaxation in space rather than merely strengthening it. Persistent dopants accumulate stress and nucleate voids as their mechanically perturbed regions overlap. In this regime, rearrangements localize at void boundaries, and active and passive particles exhibit comparable mobility, producing dynamics reminiscent of crowd mosh pits. Persistence therefore reorganizes fluidization through stress accumulation and confinement, revealing a distinct nonequilibrium localization mechanism in disordered solids.",

        "abstract": "Polymer thin films exhibit pronounced interfacial mobility gradients that modify chain relaxation, yet how these gradients govern chain-scale dynamics across depth remains incompletely understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations of freestanding glass-forming polymer films, we resolve how depth-dependent variations in segmental relaxation shape chain dynamics across a wide range of displacement scales. Near the free surface, accelerated segmental mobility suppresses Rouse-regime scaling exponents to values as low as gamma = 0.4, reflecting transient localization induced by interfacial mobility gradients rather than topological entanglement. In contrast, the film interior exhibits enhanced Rouse scaling exponents consistent with predictions of the Heterogeneous Rouse Model (HRM), indicating that bulk dynamic heterogeneity compresses the Rouse regime. Mapping the minimum scaling exponent gamma_min across depth reveals a linear gradient that separates the bulk-like enhancement regime from the surface-induced suppression regime of chain dynamical scaling. Together, these results demonstrate that bulk and interfacial dynamic heterogeneity modify chain relaxation in opposite ways and establish Rouse scaling as a sensitive, spatially resolved probe of glassy dynamical heterogeneity and interfacial dynamical gradients in polymers.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22977v1",
        "abstract": "We study the free energy and dynamics of a closed elastic filament (a one-dimensional curve in two dimensions) whose local internal state is specified by curvature, stretch, and a scalar density field representing, for example, the concentration of an absorbed species. The density variable has a tendency to phase-separate whereas the local spontaneous curvature is concentration-dependent. There is also a coupling between concentration and the stretching of the filament, although our main interest is in the nearly inextensible regime. We formulate and simulate the dynamics, comprising a coupled Willmore flow and Cahn-Hilliard gradient flow on the full differential geometry of a closed filament, addressing issues that previous work typically sidestepped by restricting to the Monge gauge. We use a numerical strategy for global free energy minimization, presenting the equilibrium shapes and density profiles across a wide range of model parameters. The phase diagram is dominated by a relatively small number of simple shapes that exhibit, as expected, strong coupling between local curvature and concentration. We also find regimes where curvature and/or stretching energies suppress phase separation altogether. For selected parameter values we present fully dynamical results, tracking the time evolution of the various contributions to the free energy. The dynamics often arrive at metastable minima rather than the equilibrium state - for example, at states with more than the minimum number of interfaces between coexisting phases. The metastability of these states is absent for phase separation on a rigid circular domain and thus a direct result of the coupling between geometry and density.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the steady uniform shear flow of a granular gas composed of inelastic and rough Maxwell particles. Exploiting the mean-field character of the model, we derive exact expressions for the collisional production rates of the second-degree moments and obtain a closed nonlinear solution for the stress and spin-spin tensors. The rotational-to-translational temperature ratio and the proportionality between the spin-spin and stress tensors are shown to be independent of the coefficient of normal restitution and determined solely by roughness and moment of inertia. The reduced normal stresses, shear stress, and shear rate are obtained explicitly in terms of two effective parameters generalizing the cooling and stress relaxation rates of the smooth model. From these results we derive exact expressions for the non-Newtonian shear viscosity, the first viscometric function, and the friction coefficient. The dependence of the rheological properties on the normal and tangential restitution coefficients is analyzed in detail, revealing strong non-Newtonian behavior and nonmonotonic effects of roughness. The results reduce, in the appropriate limits, to those of the inelastic Maxwell model for smooth particles and to the Pidduck gas in the elastic perfectly rough case.",

Yet, tissue shape changes depend on tissue rheology, which in turn arises from the interplay of large numbers of cells. Here, we link cell- and tissue-scale mechanics by constructing mean-field rheological relations for the vertex model. In contrast to past work in the field, we study a vertex model with an explicit viscous friction. We also include two different cellular mechanisms creating active, anisotropic stresses. Our mean-field model accounts for cell shape and the non-linear elastic and visco-plastic regimes. We validate our results by predicting the response to large-amplitude oscillatory shear. There are several vertex model variants, and comparing to results from the literature, we show that their rheology depends on a number of model details. Our approach should be sufficiently general to construct non-linear mean-field constitutive relations for any cell-based tissue model.",

In this process, the meiosis-specific recombinase DMC1 plays a pivotal role in homology search and pairing, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its function remain unclear. Using single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that the human DMC1–ssDNA presynaptic complex employs a diffusion-based mechanism to search for homologous DNA. Although this diffusing complex generates a migrating DNA “bubble,” it cannot align with the homologous sequence in the absence of free DMC1 protein. Strikingly, the meiosis-specific cofactor complex HOP2–MND1 compensates for the lack of free DMC1 and enables homology recognition. Notably, HOP2–MND1 achieves this by codiffusing with the presynaptic complex, acting to clamp the ssDNA–dsDNA junctions and maintain an expanded DNA bubble conducive to sequence alignment. Our findings identify DMC1 together with HOP2–MND1 as a functional homology search unit and provide mechanistic insights into how auxiliary factors regulate DMC1-driven strand exchange during meiotic recombination.",

Many species of cyanobacteria exhibit gliding motility along surfaces to navigate complex environments and adapt to fluctuating conditions. Here, we studied the gliding motility of filamentous cyanobacteria\n                    Lyngbya lagerheimii\n                    at the transition between different physical environments. We show that on a dry surface, a filament adopts a curved shape that turns right while gliding. When a filament switches the gliding direction, the curvature is initially preserved and a filament can turn left as long as it backtracks along a slime trace. We propose a model of chiral motility that explains the bending based on the right-handed rotation of gliding filaments and a velocity mismatch between the leading and the trailing end of the filament. The mechanism involves a unique way of transferring the structural chirality to the macroscale and also a unique physical navigation mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Biological systems often operate at the boundary between order and chaos, transitioning from directed to irregular dynamics to achieve adaptability and robustness. Reproducing such transitions in artificial soft matter remains a central challenge. Here, we report a biomimetic regime of directron dynamics in achiral nematic liquid crystals, in which coherent, directed motion collectively evolves into chaos. Driven by multi-directron interactions, the system develops coexisting directron families with competing trajectories, displaying randomized motion, dynamic assembly formation and spontaneous fission of high energy to low energy daughter directrons - all of which mimics the phenotypic diversity observed in biological groups. Above a critical electric field, these interactions drive the system into a chaotic state that is distinct from the directed behaviours reported previously. We further introduce a minimal dipole-based model that qualitatively captures the underlying physics of this transition. Together, our results establish an artificial active system in which chaos emerges intrinsically from interactions, offering a versatile platform to study biological dynamics and opening new avenues for liquid-crystal-based soft-matter applications involving adaptive transport, cargo delivery, and energy transduction",

        "abstract": "Kinesin-1 mediates intracellular cargo transport along microtubules. The canonical kinesin-1 complex is composed of two KIF5 motor subunits (also known as kinesin heavy chain; KHCs) and two cargo-binding kinesin light chains (KLCs), and KIF5 is generally thought to function as a homodimer. Whether kinesin-1 forms higher-order assemblies beyond the dimer has remained unclear. Here, we show that the neuronal isotype KIF5C assembles into tetramers through reversible association of two dimers. Gel filtration and mass photometry demonstrate that KIF5C partitions between dimeric and tetrameric forms in vitro. Deletion of the autoinhibitory elbow region strongly shifts this distribution toward tetramers, indicating that conformational activation promotes intermolecular assembly. Tetramer formation requires the C-terminal tail but remains compatible with KLC binding. Single-molecule motility assays reveal that tetramer-enriched KIF5C exhibits increased landing rates and longer run lengths compared with the dimeric form. These findings identify reversible tetramerization as a previously unrecognized property of kinesin-1 and suggest that conformational activation not only relieves intramolecular inhibition but also promotes higher-order assembly, revealing an additional layer of regulation that may tune motor activity in neurons.",

We introduce a spatial evolution assay in which populations expand from single, genetically tailored yeast cells, enabling quantitative tracking of the full spatiotemporal trajectories of continually emerging resistant mutants under intermittent treatment. By integrating these observations with a mechanistically interpretable in silico model in a real-to-sim-to-real loop, we identify an effective phase transition in schedule space that defines an optimal balance between population control and sustained resistance confinement, which we validate experimentally.

        "abstract": "Membrane mimetics such as lipid bicelles and nanodiscs have become indispensable platforms for high-resolution structural, dynamical, and functional studies of membrane-associated systems by NMR spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, and X-ray crystallography. In particular, magnetically aligned bicelles and nanodiscs uniquely enable the measurement of anisotropic NMR interactions, providing direct access to membrane geometry, lipid order, thickness, and molecular dynamics. However, the quantitative interpretation of such anisotropic NMR spectra has been hindered by the absence of physically rigorous dynamic models that properly account for the coupled effects of molecular diffusion, orientational distribution, and membrane deformation. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dynamic simulation of 31P chemical shift anisotropy and 14N quadrupolar NMR lineshapes in bicelles and nanodiscs. The model explicitly incorporates lipid diffusion, orientational distributions on curved membrane geometries, and membrane thinning, enabling physically consistent and quantitatively accurate reproduction of experimentally observed anisotropic lineshapes. Using this framework, we simulate dynamic 31P and 14N NMR spectra of DMPC/DHPC bicelles and nanodiscs and demonstrate how membrane thinning and lipid diffusion govern the apparent reduction of anisotropic interactions commonly observed upon peptide or protein association. This approach establishes a general physical basis for interpreting anisotropic NMR spectra of aligned membrane mimetics and provides a unified platform for quantitative investigation of membrane structure, dynamics, and membrane-active biomolecular interactions.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how structures arise in microbial communities remains an outstanding challenge in bacterial ecology. When replicating within dense and confined environments, bacterial populations may collectively self-organize as a result of mechanical interactions. Model dual-populations of bacteria, colonizing open-ended microchannels, were found to either quickly fixate to a single population or segregate into long-lived, coexisting populations. This latter quasi-stability results from the alignment of bacteria into lanes, forcing cells to grow toward the open ends of the channel, with inter-lane invasion events driving the boundary between populations. Here we apply agent-based (AB) simulations to explore the boundary dynamics between dual-bacterial populations of varying morphology and division rate. We find that the simulated boundary dynamics are well described by a simple drift-diffusion model, which enables us to estimate the mean time to fixation within competitive scenarios where the fixation time is difficult to access by AB simulations. Coccus cells display a competitive advantage over bacillus cells as they can more effectively invade and ultimately fixate, while coexisting populations of bacillus cells are `effectively' stable. And while faster-dividing cells should have a selective advantage, their morphology determines if this advantage drives fixation or acts as a defensive strategy to maintain their population. These findings highlight the critical role that cell morphology and mechanics play in shaping bacterial communities.",

The histone-to-protamine transition involves the occurrence of double-strand breaks, and is facilitated by transition proteins including those containing high-mobility-group (HMG) boxes. Here we used optical tweezers and microscopy to study the actions of HMGB1 and protamine on DNA. Confocal scans of GFP-HMGB1 on overstretched {lambda}-DNA show 2-3 foci that spread on the DNA upon retraction. Spreading of foci coincides with reannealing of ssDNA tracks, confirming their localization at ss-dsDNA junctions. Whereas the force-extension curves of protamine-bound {lambda}-DNA show tangles that withstand forces > 60 pN, premixing protamine with HMGB1 produces only bends and bridges (~ 20 pN). The counteraction of HMGB1 involves its acidic C-terminal tail, as HMGB1-{Delta}C fails to prevent tangle formation. In line with these single-molecule results, brightfield and confocal imaging shows that HMGB1 converts protamine-dsDNA aggregates into liquid droplets whereas HMGB1-{Delta}C fails to do so. Together, these observations support our hypothesis that chromatin-associated proteins like HMGB1 help maintain early protamine-mediated DNA condensates in a liquid state, enabling the recruitment of the repair machinery to restore the duplex structure.",

QDs, which possess both a broad excitation range and a narrow emission bandwidth, are inherently suited for multicolor imaging at various wavelengths. However, applying multicolor QD-SPT with multiple biomolecular targets has been challenging due to the limited methods for specifically conjugating QDs to biomolecules. Here, we propose a DNA hybridization-based QD labeling method that generates several specific interactions based on sequence. QD fused with 20-mer oligo DNA specifically labeled membrane lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) covalently bound to complementary oligo DNA, forming a stable label that is suitable for SPT. The combination of polyA-polyT sequence as the linker oligo caused more QDs to fuse to DPPE compared with a random sequence linker. Oligo DNA-based QD-SPT accurately reflected the diffusion dynamics of DPPE measured using the single-fluorescence tracking technique and was compatible with conventional QD-SPT utilizing secondary antibody Fab. Using different pairs of oligo DNA sequences, we successfully achieved multicolor QD-SPT that distinguishes a lateral diffusion of DPPE and a membrane protein, GABAA receptor, within the same cell. The oligo DNA-based QD labeling method developed in this study is anticipated to substantially advance simultaneous multicolor QD-SPT of different living cell membrane molecules specific to DNA sequences.",

        "abstract": "RNA is a flexible biopolymer that adopts diverse conformations while forming structural motifs essential for its function. Classical RNA force fields often show limited transferability and inefficient sampling of transitions between stable states, particularly in moderately large RNA. To address these limitations, quantum-informed machine learning (ML) potentials have recently emerged as a promising alternative, offering improved accuracy and transferability relative to classical force fields. Here, we assess ML potentials for exploring RNA conformations using the adenine-adenine dinucleoside monophosphate (ApA) dimer, a fundamental RNA building block. We generated an extensive quantum-mechanical (QM) dataset for ApA conformations obtained from temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics (TREMD) simulations. Despite its small size, the ApA dimer exhibits six conformations in which quantum effects and solvent-mediated interactions play crucial roles. Using this dataset, we parameterized ML potentials based on the equivariant MACE architecture and informed by both ab-initio and semi-empirical data. The resulting potentials reproduce key conformational features of the ApA system, including base stacking, sugar puckering, and backbone flexibility, and provide broader coverage of structural transitions than the general-purpose SO3LR and MACE-OFF24 models. These findings highlight the importance of quantum-accurate RNA force fields towards the structural and energetic characterization of RNA complexes.",

We develop a dual explainable AI framework that systematically interrogates AI Co-Folding models AlphaFold3, Protenix, Boltz-2, Chai-1, and DynamicBind on rigorously stratified datasets of orthosteric and allosteric ligand-protein complexes. While all AI models excel in accurate modeling of orthosteric ligand binding, a universal and architecture-independent collapse emerges in prediction of allosteric complexes. The biophysical logic for this dichotomy is unveiled through physics-based lens of the energy landscape theory and local frustration analysis. Orthosteric binding creates dominant energetic funnels via ligand-induced minimal frustration quenching, while allosteric sites preserve neutral frustration landscapes in both apo and holo protein states. The findings show that conformational heterogeneity and evolutionary plasticity encoded in allosteric binding landscapes may conceal the recurrent recognition patterns AI models are trained to detect. By linking prediction outcomes to frustration landscapes, this study recasts AI shortcomings in allosteric ligand binding as diagnostic indicators of fundamental biophysical constraints, establishing a physics-informed framework that turns the allosteric blind spot into mechanistic insight for next-generation landscape-aware predictive tools",

We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions.

Spins interact ferromagnetically within each block and antiferromagnetically across blocks, generating frustration between magnetic ordering and spatial organization. By employing a mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations for self-avoiding walks on the cubic lattice, we investigate the system's response to an external magnetic field. We discover a rich phase diagram that includes: a swollen phase with both filaments magnetically disordered and spatially extended; a mixed compact phase characterized by a single globule in which the two filaments are strongly intertwined; a segregated compact phase composed of two globular, magnetically ordered, and spatially separated blocks. Further, if the magnitude of the intra-block ferromagnetic interaction differs between the two blocks, we observe a hybrid segregated (``tadpole'') phase where one extended block coexists with a collapsed one. Mean-field predictions are in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo results for the location of the phase boundaries. These findings provide a minimal statistical-mechanical framework for field-controlled self-assembly of tunable patterns by magnetically heterogeneous polymers.

        "abstract": "We investigate thermal avalanche dynamics in amorphous solids using elastoplastic models with local activation rules and no external driving. Dynamical heterogeneities, quantified through persistence measurements and the associated four-point susceptibility $χ_4$, reveal the emergence of correlated spatiotemporal rearrangements as temperature is varied. As temperature increases, avalanche statistics evolve from scale-free behavior with exponential cutoffs to regimes dominated by system-spanning runaway events. We identify a system-size-dependent critical temperature $T_c(L)$ that separates intermittent avalanche dynamics from thermally assisted flow, where self-sustained avalanches transiently fluidize the system. We show that $T_c(L)$ decreases algebraically with increasing system size, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit arbitrarily small but finite temperatures may destabilize the intermittent regime. The relation between avalanche size and duration resembles that in sheared systems, whereas the statistics of minimal distances to yielding reveal a temperature-driven reorganization of marginal stability absent in strictly driven overdamped dynamics. Our results demonstrate that thermal activation alone can generate a finite-size-controlled instability scale in disordered elastic media.",

However, large arrays have thus far not been realized. One challenge is that as the number of elements in an array increases, the complexity of connecting them grows. Here, we show that row-column addressing provides a promising architecture for the efficient operation of a large micro-heater array. We introduce a programmable 32 x 32 microheater array consisting of individually addressable robust platinum (Pt)-based Joule heating elements- each smaller than 300 micrometer. We show that combining high-voltage multiplexed electronics and sequential addressing controlled by a high frequency clock, allows the independent operation of the 1024 microheater elements. We demonstrate the generation of heat images and the patterning of metallic structures formed from the liquid metal Gallium.

At small average sizes, the kinetics is predicted to follow the classical Lifshits-Slezov-Wagner cubic law, with the rate proportional to the molecular solubility of the oil in water, as if no micelles were present. At larger particle sizes the kinetics transitions to the Wagner's quadratic law. The crossover point for the kinetics depends on the dynamics of the oil solubilizate-micelle exchange; it is set by the value of the oil atmosphere distribution parameter, kappa, which, somewhat like Debye length, is proportional to the square root of the micellar concentration. It should be noted that in the range when 1/kappa is close to the particle average radius, the ripening kinetics still nearly follows the cubic law, with only moderate deviations; in this case, the micellar effects are experimentally seen not as the deviations from the linearity, but as an apparent increase in the cubic rate. The increase is predicted to be larger in case of nonionic micelles of ethylene oxide type compared to ionic ones.",

        "abstract": "Dense suspensions of self-propelled bacteria and related active fluids exhibit spontaneous flow generation, vortex formation, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics despite operating at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers. These phenomena, commonly referred to as active turbulence, display striking visual and statistical similarities to classical inertial turbulence while arising from fundamentally different nonequilibrium mechanisms. In this article, we present a combined review and theoretical study of hydrodynamic models for dense active fluids, with particular emphasis on bacterial suspensions described by the Toner--Tu--Swift--Hohenberg (TTSH) framework. We review key experimental and theoretical developments underlying the analogy between active and inertial turbulence, highlighting the emergence of multiple dynamical regimes and the conditions under which universal spectral and intermittent behavior arises in homogeneous systems. Moving beyond the conventional assumption of spatially uniform activity, we introduce a minimal model in which the activity field is heterogeneous and dynamically advected by the flow it generates. Thus treating activity as a spatiotemporally evolving field coupled to the TTSH dynamics, we investigate how advection and diffusion lead to sharp activity fronts, confinement of turbulent motion, and complex interfacial morphologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that spatial variations in activity can induce transient coexistence of distinct spectral regimes and that universality in active turbulence is inherently local and time-dependent in heterogeneous systems. These findings underscore the importance of treating activity as a dynamical field in its own right and provide a framework for studying active turbulence in more realistic, spatially structured biological and synthetic active matter systems.",

This universal feature contrasts with the non-universal correlations between cell geometry, rearrangement rate, and fluidity, which depend sensitively on the underlying modes of active force. Our results demonstrate that persistent Brownian motion provides a minimal framework for describing tissue dynamics, while distinct active forces leave identifiable structural and dynamical signatures, thereby enabling inference of the dominant active force in fluid state tissues.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21884v1",
        "abstract": "We study stress relaxation in several types of entangled monodisperse linear polymer melts by comparing the shear stress relaxation modulus, $G(t)$, with the end-to-end vector autocorrelation function, $P(t)$. The study includes three Kremer-Grest bead-spring models with varying chain stiffness, as well as a chemistry-specific coarse-grained model of \\emph{cis}-1,4-polybutadiene. For each model, multiple chain lengths were simulated, spanning a range of $N/N_e = 5$-$50$ entanglements per chain. We observe that in all cases the behavior of $G(t)$, beyond the short-time Rouse regime, is accurately described by $G^0_{\\mathrm{N}}[P(t)]^2$, where the chain-length-independent prefactor $G^0_{\\mathrm{N}}$ denotes the plateau modulus. This correlation is consistent with both double reptation and dynamic tube dilation models of polymer relaxation, although the two models are based on different physical pictures. The double reptation model represents the melt as a transient network in which stress relaxation is governed by the survival probability of pairwise entanglements. The dynamic tube dilation model, however, assumes that the tube of constraints surrounding a polymer chain progressively enlarges as relaxation proceeds. The relation $G(t) = G^0_\\mathrm{N}[P(t)]^2$ can serve as a basis for determining the plateau modulus and the corresponding entanglement length. It also simplifies the modeling of $G(t)$, since an accurate analytical expression for $P(t)$ is sufficient to describe the long-time behavior of $G(t)$. We further compare the simulation data for $P(t)$ and $G(t)$ with theoretical predictions.",

        "abstract": "Characterizing the geometric boundaries of protein secondary structures is fundamental to understanding macromolecular folding. By applying the discrete Hasimoto map to translate backbone geometry into a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schrödinger potential $V_{\\mathrm{re}}[n]$, we establish a frequency-domain framework for protein conformations. Short-time Fourier transform analysis across 320,453 residues from 1,986 non-redundant proteins defines a local spectral entropy $H_{\\mathrm{spec}}$ that consistently orders structural states. Helical segments emerge as narrow-band low-entropy regimes dominated by zero-frequency components, whereas coils manifest as broadband noise. We demonstrate that boundaries separating these states exhibit step-like sharpness characteristic of a first-order-like geometric transition with a sub-residue median width of 0.145 residues. This abrupt kinematic transition provides a spatial counterpart to the cooperative Zimm--Bragg thermodynamic model of helix nucleation. The extreme spatial narrowness exposes an intrinsic limitation governed by the Gabor uncertainty principle, explaining why the pointwise integrability residual $E[n]$ acts as an effective high-pass filter for boundary detection. Guided by this limit we introduce a dual-probe approach combining the high-pass residual for local torsion discontinuities with a low-frequency energy ratio $R_{\\mathrm{LF}}$ measuring the DC-dominated flatness of helical interiors. Unifying these complementary signals improves the detection area under the curve from 0.783 to 0.815. Because high-entropy broadband regions coincide with the flexible loops and hinges implicated in allostery, the spectral entropy of the Hasimoto potential may serve as a sequence-agnostic geometric proxy for mapping functional dynamics from backbone coordinates.",

        "abstract": "Sensory information propagates through successive processing stages in the brain, where synaptic weight patterns between stations determine how downstream neurons decode information from upstream populations. Although optimized synaptic connectivity can enhance information transmission, it requires precise weight tuning. Recent evidence depicting substantial synaptic volatility raises two fundamental questions: How does coarse-tuning of synaptic connectivity affect information transmission? What strategies could the nervous system employ to maintain reliable communication despite synaptic fluctuations? We addressed these questions by analyzing the signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR$) for binary stimulus discrimination under two decoding schemes: a naive population average and an optimized linear decoder. For the naive decoder, we found that $SNR$ remains largely insensitive to synaptic imprecision, since performance is already limited by correlated noise in neuronal responses. For the optimal decoder, we identified three distinct regimes. Under weak coarse-tuning, $SNR^2$ scales linearly with population size $N$. Under moderate coarse-tuning, scaling becomes sublinear. Under strong coarse-tuning, the regime most consistent with observed neuronal heterogeneity, $SNR$ saturates and can not be improved by recruiting larger populations. This limitation persists even when incorporating feedforward or recurrent network architectures. These findings suggest that in the biologically relevant regime of strong coarse-tuning, naive and optimal decoders can achieve qualitatively similar performance. The analysis shows that effective readout under synaptic volatility is constrained to an invariant low-dimensional manifold aligned with the naive decoder, potentially pointing to a fundamental principle for robust neural computation in the face of ongoing synaptic remodeling.",

Some theories predict that self-avoiding surfaces would crumple in the absence of bending rigidity, while most simulations suggested that they would remain flat. Recent simulations on ideal membranes with lattice perforations suggest that systematically removing surface area from a membrane may provide an alternative way to crumpling self-avoiding surfaces. We perform extensive numerical simulations of two models of fully flexible elastic tethered surfaces in which self-avoidance can be systematically and continuously tuned to the ideal limit. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, these surfaces remain flat with a size exponent $ν=1$ for any finite degree of self-avoidance, with or without membrane perforations.",

        "abstract": "Glycans are not only one of the four fundamental macromolecular classes that constitute life, but also the most abundant among these four across the Earth. However, compared with proteins and nucleic acids, our understanding of the structures and functional mechanisms of glycans remains limited. Moreover, it is generally challenging to obtain high-resolution three-dimensional structures of glycans. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of the CryoSeek strategy in enabling high-throughput structural determination of glycans, thereby presenting novel avenues for their structural investigation. Meanwhile, unlike proteins, near atomic resolution density maps of glycofibrils do not inherently facilitate the determination of absolute hand, which is a prerequisite for building atomic models of glycofibrils. Existing absolute hand determination methods have severe limitations in the case of glycofibrils from natural sources. In this study, we introduce Ahaha, a straightforward and efficient method for determining such absolute hand in cryogenic electron microscopy. With their absolute hand measured by Ahaha, we built atomic models of four glycofibrils derived from a natural water sample, facilitating the study of glycans. The online service of Ahaha is available at\n                    https://cryoseek.org/ahaha\n                    .",

        "abstract": "Organisms often inhabit environments comprising complex structures across various scales. Animals rely on visual information from surrounding geometrical structures for navigation. Even at the microscale, various microsediments form complex structures in microbial habitats. The movement of microorganisms is passively affected by collisions and hydrodynamic interactions with surrounding structures. However, the influence of microenvironmental geometry on behavioral changes of unicellular organisms that lack visual perception remains unclear. Here, we developed geometrically structured chambers to investigate anchoring site preferences in the swimming ciliate\n                    Stentor coeruleus\n                    . Our experiments revealed that\n                    S. coeruleus\n                    preferentially anchored in narrow regions characterized by specific geometrical features, including corner angle, depth, and curvature at the corner end. Before anchoring, free-swimming\n                    S. coeruleus\n                    changed its behavior to move along the boundary wall of the chambers, accompanied by Ca\n                    2+\n                    -induced asymmetrical body deformation. To further investigate how\n                    S. coeruleus\n                    moves along the wall continuously, we conducted a hydrodynamic simulation and revealed that the asymmetric morphology causes asymmetric propulsive forces, explaining wall-following behavior through physical interactions with a wall. Thus, morphological change near a wall causes wall-following behavior, facilitating the identification of these narrow anchoring sites. Our findings indicate that environmental geometry drives behavioral transitions in\n                    S. coeruleus\n                    through simple biophysical processes, enabling spatial selection without visual cues.

Many developmental processes that involve such cell shape changes, most prominently embryonic cell division, are spatially confined by eggshells. To investigate the potential role of confinement in redirecting active stresses and enabling symmetry breaking phenomena during cell shape transformations, we study a hydrodynamic minimal model in which the cell cortex is represented as an active fluid surface that undergoes symmetric division in the absence of confinement. When enclosed by an ellipsoidal shell, a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition emerges at a critical degree of confinement, where symmetrically dividing surfaces become unstable and polarized geometries appear. We show that this transition is controlled by the tightness of the confinement and analyze the solution space of stationary surfaces to identify the mechanisms underlying confinement-induced symmetry breaking.",

        "abstract": "The elastic properties of granular hydrogels are commonly characterised under wet conditions, yet the influence of capillary interactions remains unclear. In practical applications, hydrogels operate in aqueous environments containing dissolved ionic species, where swelling and elastic behaviour depend sensitively on ionic conditions. In this study, an experimental setup is developed to measure elastic responses of granular hydrogels under wet conditions. This setup directly observes liquid bridges formation and its evolution during compression. Our results show that neglecting capillary contributions leads to a systematic underestimation of the Young's modulus of hydrogels. Such an underestimation due to the capillary interaction increases as the sample size or its intrinsic stiffness decreases. In addition to the swelling ratio, the tested samples were also prepared under controlled salinity levels. The experimentally observed dependence of stiffness on swelling and salinity conditions is well captured by a modified constitutive model. The development of this study offers a robust testing protocol for measuring elastic properties of hydrogels under various environmental conditions.",

However, how divalent metals impact its catalytic function, and consequently its editing efficiency in different cells, remains unclear. Here, extensive molecular simulations, Markov State Models, biochemical and NMR experiments, demonstrate that divalent metals - Mg2+, Ca2+, and Co2+ - promote activation of the catalytic HNH domain by binding within a dynamically forming divalent metal binding pocket (DBP) at the HNH-RuvC interface. Mutations in DBP residues disrupt HNH activation and impair the coupled catalytic activity of both nucleases, identifying this cryptic DBP as a key regulator of Cas9s metal-dependent activity. The ionic strength thereby promotes Cas9s conformational activation, while its catalytic activity is metal-specific. These findings are critical to improving the metal-dependent function of Cas9 and its use for genome editing in different cells and organisms.",

In this work, we assess the capability of CG-FMD to model ligand recognition at the deeply buried colchicinoids site of the tubulin {beta}-heterodimer, a multisite protein of strategic importance. We investigated the binding of colchicine, podophyllotoxin and combretastatin-A4, recovering free energy profiles with improved statistical convergence compared to AA-FMD and comparable to experimental references. In particular CG-FMD binding free energies present mean absolute errors between 3 and 10 kJ mol-1. These results propose CG-FMD as an efficient, physics-based framework for probing ligand binding to challenging sites.",

The CCPs formed coacervates in the caged state and were partially dispersed upon blue-light irradiation. Photo-uncaging occurred rapidly, inducing coacervate dispersion. A mutant CCP with reduced π–π interactions exhibited efficient photo-dependent disassembly and enabled the encapsulation and release of a fluorescently labeled adenosine 5′-triphosphate (Bodipy-ATP) upon irradiation.

Using SM3FS, we stretched, overstretched, or unzipped 241 different DNA structures and generated 131,847 single-molecule traces from a quarter-million observations. High sequence throughput allowed us to identify DNA structures that are kinetically stable yet mechanically fragile (Frupture < 3 pN at 0.5 pN s-1), revealing how mechanosensitivity can arise as an intrinsic property of multivalent systems.

The engine operates via sequential RNA–DNA hybridization and enzymatic cleavage by RNase H, enabling reversible switching between folded and unfolded conformations without external intervention. By modulating RNA and enzyme concentrations and controlling temperature, we achieve tunable switching kinetics, with transition periods as short as ~10 s. Kinetic modeling reveals that the folding pathway is governed by both productive RNA binding and the enzymatic clearance of misfolded intermediates, while unfolding is primarily controlled by RNase H activity. Since the RNA fuel binds specifically to the DNA strands, each engine is addressable simply by changing the sequences. This work demonstrates a programmable, self-resetting molecular actuator and offers a blueprint for building more complex nanomechanical systems with forces and energies comparable to molecular motors.",

Cryo-EM is a mature technology, but preparing the grids remains a major bottleneck. Here, we evaluate the cryoWriter, a blotting-free, microfluidic grid-preparation robot that writes nanoliter volumes onto EM grids in a controlled environment. Using capillary-writing in spiral or line patterns, we prepared high-quality grids from minimal sample volumes and obtained near-atomic reconstructions for test specimens, including TMV, apoferritin, and the membrane protein TRPM4. We further demonstrate programmable deposition modes, such as writing the sample twice to boost particle density, or two-line writing for on-grid mixing to visualize time-resolved protein-ligand binding. In a challenging case (NrS-1 DNA polymerase), the cryoWriter grids exhibited reduced orientation bias relative to conventional blotting, enabling a more isotropic reconstruction. These results show that the cryoWriter provides a versatile platform for reproducible low volume cryo-EM grid preparation and for on-grid biochemical workflows.",

In domain-linker-domain (DLD) proteins, linker-mediated inter-domain relative positions and orientations are functionally relevant, yet their dynamical behavior in solution normally remain poorly described. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) provides ensemble-averaged structural information for such systems; however, coupling with computational modeling is required to accurately describe the dynamic behavior of this family of proteins in solution. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of five ensemble-generation strategies applied to a set of eighteen proteins sharing the same two globular domains, connected by naturally occurring linkers of varying length and composition. Modeling methods based on different underlying principles are compared by assessing their agreement to experimental SAXS data, showing a large disparity and systematic structural biases among them. Furthermore, for each approach, we examine the effect of refinement against SAXS restraints and assess its capacity to describe the experimental data, as well as the induced biases in global dimensions and inter-domain distance distributions. This analysis underlines the importance of the initial conformational pool for deriving experimentally compatible ensembles. Overall, this work provides a high-quality benchmark for SAXS-driven ensemble modeling of flexible, multidomain proteins and establishes a framework for the critical interpretation of solution scattering data in systems with pronounced conformational heterogeneity.",

Pseudo-helical averaging processing strategies have been developed to generate cryo-EM reconstructions of microtubules with and without decorating protein-binding partners, but these pipelines can be difficult to implement for the average user, especially for undecorated filaments. Here, we describe MiCSPARC, a cryo-EM processing pipeline developed around CryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017), which leverages automated particle picking and fast 3D refinement times in CryoSPARC to determine structures of both decorated and undecorated microtubules. We generated reconstructions of undecorated GDP microtubules, as well as kinesin-1 motor domain-decorated GMPCPP filaments at resolutions of up to 2.8 [A], demonstrating the robustness of the pipeline. Based on its convenient implementation and ability to routinely generate high-resolution, seam-corrected microtubule reconstructions, MiCSPARC should provide a valuable tool for understanding microtubule dynamics, microtubule-associated proteins, and microtubule-targeting agents.",

Yet the physical mechanisms governing CSF-driven solute transport remain poorly understood, limiting the design of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting brain clearance and drug delivery.  Pulsatile CSF flow in the cranial subarachnoid space (cSAS), is driven by cardiac, respiratory, and sleep-related vasomotion. Over longer timescales weaker steady flows, such as inertial steady streaming, Stokes drift, and production-drainage flow, may contribute to solute transport, but their role and relative importance remain unclear.  Here, we develop a simplified two-dimensional model of CSF flow and solute transport in the cSAS using lubrication theory. Through multiple-timescale and asymptotic analyses, we derive a reduced long-time transport equation in which advection is governed by the Lagrangian mean velocity, incorporating steady streaming, production-drainage flow, and Stokes drift.  Analysing three physiologically relevant case studies, we show that steady flows can substantially reshape concentration profiles, enhance dispersion, and alter clearance efficiency. Our results clarify the mechanisms underlying CSF-mediated transport, predict distinct regimes in humans and mice, and highlight the importance of subject-specific physiological parameters when interpreting contrast-agent and intrathecal drug-delivery studies.",

        "abstract": "Humans’ ability for generalization is outstanding. It is flexible enough to identify cases where knowledge from prior tasks is relevant, even when many features of the current task are different, such as the sensory stimuli or the size of the task state space. We have previously shown that in abstract tasks, humans can generalize knowledge in cases where the only cross-task shared feature is the statistical rules that govern the task’s state–state relationships. Here, we hypothesized that this capacity is associated with generalizable representations in the entorhinal cortex (EC). This hypothesis was based on the EC’s generalizable representations in spatial tasks and recent discoveries about its role in the representation of abstract tasks. We first develop an analysis method capable of testing for such representations in fMRI data, explain why other common methods would have failed for our task, and validate our method through a combination of electrophysiological data analysis, simulations, and fMRI sanity checks. We then show with fMRI that EC representations generalize across complex non-spatial tasks that share a hexagonal grid structural form but differ in their size and sensory stimuli, that is their only shared feature is the rules governing their statistical structure. There was no clear evidence for such generalization in EC for non-spatial tasks with clustered, as opposed to planar, structure.",

Specifically, CG simulations have emerged as a potent tool for exploring complex energy landscapes underlying biochemical processes, such as DNA transcription, as well as material design based on programmable self-assembly. In this chapter, we illustrate how the Three Interaction Site (TIS) model for DNA, a robust coarse-graining framework, can be used to study the folding landscape of DNA hairpins. We show that despite its simplicity, the TIS-DNA model quantitatively describes the hairpin folding thermodynamics and recapitu- lates many features of the kinetics, including the multiplicity of pathways. The free energy landscape exhibits 'single-funnel' character with a distinct bias towards the folded state. It is likely that folding initiates through non-specific collapse of the DNA chain, involving multiple excursions on the energy landscape, until the opposing strands are approximately aligned. Subsequently, the loop region becomes more ordered, and after the first native- contact nucleates, the rest of the process becomes essentially downhill.",

        "abstract": "Collective behavior in biological systems was first captured by the Vicsek model, in which particles align their velocities in the average direction of neighbors, leading to coherent motion and showing an order-disorder transition. However, in many complex environments, the interactions are non-reciprocal, lacking an action-reaction symmetry. Using framework of the Vicsek model, we implement non-reciprocity by restricting interactions to neighbors located inside a finite vision cone, for a particle by limiting its set of interacting neighbors which fall within a vision-cone, providing a minimal description for cognitive perception. Using detailed numerical simulations, we explore the clustering and flocking behavior due to competition between noise and limited visual perception in the presence of alignment interaction. For low noise, with reduction in the vision angle the system shows transition from a global coherent motion to locally ordered small-sized clusters. This behavior is confirmed through the steady-state distributions of velocity components and their fluctuation relative to the global mean. This is also characterized using a polar order-parameter and a two-point velocity correlation function. Interestingly, at small vision angles, particles exhibit strong short-range correlations within clusters even in the absence of any global coherence. Time-evolution of the related correlation functions illustrate the pathways towards the emergence of such structures. The time dependence of the average cluster size and the length-scale calculated from the two-point velocity correlation show scaling behavior and indicate that the emergence of density field clustering is a consequence of the velocity-field coherence. Any kind of ordering and clustering disappear in the limit of high noise and low vision-angle regime.",

        "abstract": "Inertia is intrinsic to many living and synthetic active systems, from animals and robotic agents to colloidal swimmers, and it strongly shapes transport. Many such systems employ intermittent restart protocols to regulate exploration. Stochastic resetting provides a theoretical framework for these strategies and a route to control nonequilibrium steady states, yet the role of inertia in reset-controlled active dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we study an inertial active Brownian particle subject to complete stochastic resetting of position, velocity, and orientation in two dimensions. Using a moment-generating framework together with the Final-Value Theorem, we derive closed-form steady-state moments up to fourth order as functions of inertia, activity, and reset rate. We show that inertia fundamentally modifies reset-controlled transport: at large reset rates the steady-state mean-squared displacement is suppressed much more strongly than in the overdamped limit, yielding enhanced localization near the reset point. At the same time, position excess-kurtosis phase diagrams reveal strongly non-Gaussian steady states characterized by a sharp central peak coexisting with heavy tails in the position distribution, indicating rare long excursions enabled by inertial persistence. The tail weight varies non-monotonically with reset rate, reflecting a competition between inertial momentum relaxation and resetting that selects an optimal regime maximizing rare excursions. Our results provide experimentally testable signatures of inertial effects in reset-controlled active systems.",

        "abstract": "Fluids in nanopores are of importance for many engineering applications, including energy storage in supercapacitors, hydrocarbons recovery from unconventional sources, or water desalination. Thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in nanopores differ from the properties of the same fluids in bulk. Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used for modeling thermodynamics of confined fluids. However, it is rarely used for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties. Here we use a rather simple DFT model for argon based on the Percus-Yevick equation, and showed that with standard parametrization it fails to predict derivative properties. However, slight adjustment in parameters leads to quantitative predictions of isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient at a selected temperature. Using the adjusted parameterization we performed the calculations of compressibility of argon confined in carbon slit pores of various sizes, and demonstrated that the compressibility of argon in confinement is lower than that in bulk and is pore size dependent. We confirmed the DFT predictions using the Monte Carlo molecular simulations. In addition to isothermal compressibility, we calculated the thermal expansion coefficient of confined argon. Our calculations showed that it behaves similar to compressibility -- it is always lower than the bulk value and gradually increases for smaller pore sizes. For several selected pore sizes we verified the DFT calculations by Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, our results suggest that the classical DFT can be utilized for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties of confined fluids, which are computationally challenging to predict using molecular simulations.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21006v1",
        "abstract": "To interpret molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is common practice to reduce the dimensionality of the molecular coordinates to a low-dimensional collective variable $x$. Projecting the high-dimensional MD data onto $x$ yields a free energy landscape $ΔG(x)$, which highlights low-energy regions corresponding to conformational states. The accurate definition of these states, however, is often impeded by projection artifacts, resulting in artificially shortened state lifetimes or even the complete disappearance of states from the analysis. As demonstrated for a two-dimensional toy model, Gaussian low-pass filtering of the high-dimensional MD coordinates can restore the underlying free energy landscape, allowing to recover previously hidden states. When applied to an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, the number of microstates increases by an order of magnitude, which leads to metastable states that are long-lived and much better defined structurally, even compared to dynamically cored state trajectories.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20886v1",
        "abstract": "The rheological properties of biological tissues, though fundamental to many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and tumor progression, remain poorly understood. A recent study showed that the active vertex model of biological tissues exhibits discontinuous shear thickening (DST), where stress and viscosity suddenly increase at a critical shear rate. What is the mechanism of DST here? Is it another nontrivial feature of activity or an inherent property of the system? To address this, we show that the thermal vertex model also exhibits DST at a small but non-zero temperature $T$. Solid-like and liquid-like cells coexist at the stress jump, and the stress-controlled flow curves exhibit the characteristic S-shape. We then introduce a constitutive model for DST in epithelial tissues. As $p_0$ increases, the theory predicts DST, followed by continuous shear thickening (CST), and finally Newtonian behavior, consistent with simulations. DST begins at the jamming point, $p_0^m$, and the Newtonian behavior starts at $p_0^*$, where the yield stress vanishes. Both $p_0^*$ and the liquid-to-solid transition stress, $σ^*$, govern the DST-CST boundary. Furthermore, $p_0^*$ and $σ^*$ also depend on $T$. Increasing $T$ reduces $p_0^*$, narrows the shear-thickening regime, and eventually destroys DST when $p_0^* \\leq p_0^m$. Thus, the primary ingredients of DST in tissue models are a finite yield stress in the unjammed regime and non-zero fluctuations, whose specific form is not important. The theory agrees well with our simulation data and also provides further testable predictions.",

In the rotating frame, the beam experiences centrifugal and Euler fictitious forces, with negligible Coriolis effects. We validate a reduced-order \\textit{elastica} model through precision experiments on slender beams rotating with a controlled sinusoidal angular velocity. Systematically exploring the parameter space, we identify regimes where inertial effects are negligible, enabling a quasi-static treatment despite harmonic driving. We characterize the transition to dynamic response using two dimensionless parameters, the Euler and centrifugal numbers, which compare centrifugal and Euler forces to bending forces. Counterintuitively, the quasi-static regime expands as rotational speed increases: faster rotation produces less dynamic response. The critical Euler number separating these regimes remains constant at low centrifugal numbers but follows square-root scaling at higher rotation rates, a transition driven by centrifugal stiffening. Our results establish the conditions under which quasi-static approximations remain valid for rotating flexible beams under harmonic driving.",

        "abstract": "We study an extreme active matter system, which is essentially a dense assembly of athermal, soft and infinitely persistent active particles. Using extensive numerical simulations we obtain jammed configurations of this system in two dimensions and probe the stability of such structures under increasing active forcing magnitude. We show that the critical active forcing magnitude for the jammed phase to yield scales with virial pressure as $f_c\\sim p^α$, with $α=1.17$, describing the yielding line. Using a Laplacian framework, we redistribute the active forces into a modified contact force network. By analysing the statistics of these redistributed forces, we obtain a very robust scaling law consistent with the passive limit, not just near the unjamming line, but in the entire jammed active phase. The probability distribution of the magnitude of the contact force deviates from the power-law form found in passive systems for values smaller than the active force. Moreover, within the jammed phase, the system displays elastic, plastic, and yielding events with increasing active forcing. This active plasticity appears abruptly and can not be captured by the continuous softening of the Hessian spectrum. However, we demonstrate that the Hessian still retains the ability to predict relaxation times. These results clarify how activity modifies force distributions and leads to deformation, plasticity and yielding in dense, jammed, infinitely persistent active matter.",

We develop a kinetic theory framework that quantitatively captures these features by   identifying the initial memory and subsequent memoryless regimes with the kinetic and hydrodynamic states,   respectively (that are well established in kinetic theory). Our analysis reveals that memory emerges during   fast transients through coupling between horizontal and vertical temperatures, a mechanism that fundamentally   constrains the accessible memory phenomenology and precludes observation of the standard Kovacs effect in   this system.

        "abstract": "Tipping points are one of the hot topics in modern physics of complex systems. But what is a tipping point? A generic definition declares it as ``a state of the system where a small change in its parameters can lead to a significant change in its properties''. Additional ingredients that often enter the definition of tipping process are the abruptness of the resulting change and its irreversibility, i.e. it is impossible to recover the initial state if one reverses the protocol of change of the parameters. However, there exists a number of different mathematical structures that can show this behavior, the one that was originally suggested as a tipping point (nowadays usually referred to as bifurcation induced tipping) is just one of many. Different preconditions and/or different level of details included into the model, reflecting also different environmental forcing, can lead to a variety of tipping mechanisms. Furthermore, in a spatially extended system and/or a system with multiple scales, different parts can react to a change in environmental conditions differently or at a different time, interacting with each other to create a tipping cascade. In this paper, using ecosystems as a paradigm of complex nonlinear open systems, we provide a critical overview of the progress made in tipping point science over the last 15 years.

We examine how the strength of the growth patterns and the aspect ratio of the bilayer influence the resulting shapes. We first investigate the effect of global area difference in the bilayer. Next, we make one of the two layers active and program it with positive or negative, localized or uniform curvature. We then present examples involving competition between two active surfaces with opposite curvature signs or different curvature distributions and understand how the final configurations follow from the principles identified earlier.

        "abstract": "The dynamic fragmentation of residually stressed solids involves a complex interplay between stored elastic energy, stress wave propagation, and crack instabilities. In this work, we investigate the fracture mechanics of chemically toughened glass through high-velocity projectile impact experiments and a novel micromechanical network model. We rigorously incorporate residual stress into the discrete lattice framework via a prescribed inelastic strain (eigenstrain) distribution, formulated as equivalent body and surface forces to ensure mesh-independent fracture paths. Our experiments and simulations demonstrate that while the fracture topology shifts from coarse to fine with increasing impact energy, the cumulative fragment size distribution consistently follows an exponential decay. Crucially, we reveal a universal scaling law: fragment size distributions from diverse loading conditions and stress profiles collapse onto a single master curve when normalized by the mean fragment area. Furthermore, the model elucidates the determinants of fragmentation, showing that the resulting fragment size is governed not only by the magnitude of residual stress but also by the steepness of the stress gradient. At the microscopic scale, we identify a mechanism for dynamic instability where non-sequential bond breaking ahead of the crack tip leads to apparent local crack speeds exceeding the Rayleigh wave speed ($c_r$). These arrested micro-branches, analogous to the Burridge-Andrews mechanism, provide a physical explanation for the \"tongue-like\" features and hackle zones observed in post-mortem fractography.",

        "abstract": "Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) are a rich source of novel structures with unique biological activities, particularly in anticoagulation and antithrombosis. MSGs, such as fucosylated chondroitin sulfates (FucCSs) and sulfated fucans (SFs), exhibit anticoagulant properties influenced by their molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkages, sulfation patterns, and fucosylation levels. Unlike traditional anticoagulants like unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), MSGs offer alternative mechanisms, potentially providing a safer therapeutic profile. Despite the recognized anticoagulant potential of MSGs, their binding mechanisms with coagulation factors and the role of metal ions to enhance binding have not been fully explored. This study investigates the binding properties of MSGs from various echinoderm species with key coagulation factors (thrombin, and factor Xa) and serpins (antithrombin, and heparin cofactor II) using surface plasmon resonance. We assessed the inhibitory effects of defined FucCSs and SFs on these interactions, using UFH and LMWH as controls. Our results show that MSGs exhibit antithrombin-independent anticoagulant activity and interact with heparin cofactor II and factor Xa, with metal ions playing a crucial role in some of these bindings. This comprehensive analysis highlights MSGs as promising anticoagulants with potential advantages in safety and efficacy compared to traditional agents.",

        "abstract": "How cell fate decisions coordinate with tissue-scale morphogenesis remains a major challenge in developmental biology. Gastruloids, three-dimensional aggregates of pluripotent stem cells that self-organise and break symmetry via polarised Brachyury/T expression, provide an ideal system to address this question. By generating gastruloids with defined initial proportions of T-expressing cells, we show that fate decisions occur collectively, with the pluripotent population delaying differentiation and controlling the timing of symmetry breaking. Mechanical measurements reveal differences in surface tension between T-positive and T-negative tissues, consistent with radial cell sorting. Finally, incorporating fate dynamics and mechanics into a computational model recapitulates the sequential symmetry-breaking events observed in vitro. Our findings identify a mechanochemical mechanism underlying axis formation, and demonstrate how multicellular systems can robustly self-organise without external signalling cues.",

        "abstract": "The rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses a major threat to human health. Tailocins, which are phage tail-like bacteriocins, offer a way to kill specific bacteria without the risks of horizontal gene transfer found in phage therapy. While the mechanism of contractile R-type tailocins is well-established, the bactericidal action of non-contractile F-type tailocins remains unresolved. Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the F-pyocin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The structure reveals a complex nanomachine made of a terminator cap (AlpD/PA0910), a helical tube (PA0633), and a tail tip that mediates a symmetry transition from sixfold to threefold. Notably, the tail tip connects to an elongated central fiber (PA0641) decorated with trimeric side fibers (PA0643/PA0646) involved in host recognition. Through genetic deletion studies and proteomic analysis, we delineate the F-pyocin assembly pathway, establishing that the tape-measure protein (PA0636) serves as a central scaffold coordinating the assembly of the tube, cap, and tail-tip modules. Structural analysis reveals a localized register shift in the central fibers coiled-coil shaft, suggesting a metastable state that may facilitate conformational changes upon host recognition. Our findings detail the atomic structure of an F-type tailocin, uncovering its coordinated assembly pathway and specialized tail-fiber architecture, which establishes a structural framework for engineering next-generation, precision antimicrobials.",

Predictive foot placement models based on center of mass state alone were compared with models that additionally included whole-body angular momentum to determine whether whole-body angular momentum contributes to foot placement control beyond linear momentum. Ten healthy adults walked on a treadmill at 2 km/h and 5 km/h while being exposed to two perturbation types: (1) a pull to the pelvis that primarily altered linear momentum (translation perturbation) and (2) simultaneous pulls to the pelvis and shoulder in opposite directions that primarily altered angular momentum (rotation perturbation). Perturbations were applied at heel strike, with a magnitude of [~]120 N and a duration of 300 ms. Whole-body kinematics were recorded using 3D motion capture and processed in OpenSim to compute linear and angular momentum. Translation perturbations caused large deviations in whole-body linear momentum with minimal changes in whole-body angular momentum, whereas rotation perturbations induced strong whole-body angular momentum deviations with smaller changes in linear momentum. Including whole-body angular momentum minimally improved foot placement predictions during early swing after rotation perturbations. These findings indicate that mediolateral foot placement is primarily governed by linear momentum dynamics.",

In MDCK cells and in cultured neurons, cAMP had a diffusion coefficient of [~]130 {micro}m2/s, similar to the diffusion coefficients of other small molecules in cytoplasm. In neuronal dendrites, a balance between diffusion and degradation led to cAMP domains with a length-scale of 27 {+/-} 11 {micro}m (mean {+/-} s.d.).

We developed a novel eye-tracking paradigm and computational models to investigate how spatial and colour information are updated across saccades in the human brain. Our findings reveal that saccades selectively impair spatial but not colour memory. Computational modelling identified that spatial representations are maintained in a dual eye-centred frame of reference which is actively updated by a noisy memory of saccades but is vulnerable to interference. Using this model, we found that specific mechanistic failures in initial encoding and memory decay, rather than the saccadic updating process itself, account for spatial working memory deficits in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

        "abstract": "Surround suppression and neural response variability are widespread cortical phenomena thought to facilitate and impede, respectively, information processing and perception. Because manipulations that elicit neural response suppression often quench variability, it has been proposed that these two phenomena share a common origin. However, the relationship between surround suppression and variability has not been systematically examined. Surround suppression is mediated by multiple circuits and mechanisms that depend on the size of the sensory stimulus and cortical layer. Variability is also laminar dependent. To understand how surround suppression and variability interact and influence laminar processing, we used laminar electrophysiological recordings to examine how neural response variability and the shared variability among neurons are modulated by visual stimulus size across the layers of macaque primary visual cortex (V1). We find that surround suppression does not always quench variability. Instead, variability is tuned for stimulus size in a layer-dependent manner. In all layers, stimulation of the receptive field (RF) reduced both individual and shared variability relative to pre-stimulus baseline. Expanding the stimulus beyond the RF, into the near RF surround, further decreased variability in infragranular layers, but had little effect in granular and supragranular layers. In contrast, large stimuli extending into the far RF surround increased both individual and shared variability, relative to their value for a stimulus matched to the RF size, in supragranular layers, but decreased them or did not change them in granular and infragranular layers. Surprisingly, stimuli smaller than the RF could increase variability above baseline values, particularly in granular and infragranular layers. Our results indicate that surround suppression and variability are not governed by a single mechanism. Instead, multiple laminar-specific circuits and mechanisms shape variability, highlighting the need for revised models of neural response variability in cortical processing.",

Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a key physiological ion whose concentration varies across species, yet its influence on circadian rhythms remains poorly understood. Using a reconstituted cyanobacterial oscillator composed of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, we investigated how NaCl modulates circadian period and temperature compensation. Increasing NaCl concentrations progressively shortened the circadian period without substantially affecting oscillation amplitude, mimicking the effects of KaiB titration. While temperature compensation was maintained across varying KaiB concentrations, changes in NaCl partially disrupted temperature compensation, as Q₁₀ values correlated positively with salt concentration. We propose that NaCl perturbs the equilibrium of KaiB conformations and oligomerization, normally stabilized across physiological temperatures, thereby modulating circadian period and temperature compensation. These findings provide insight into how physiological salt levels influence circadian timing and drive the diversification of clock proteins across species.",

        "abstract": "Picornaviruses employ internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) in their genomic RNA to hijack the hosts translational machinery. The picornavirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, employs a type 2 IRES present in its 5UTR and requires 43S ribosomal preinitiation complex (PIC), the central domain of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G, eIF4A, and an essential ITAF (IRES trans-acting factor)-polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTB1) to form 48S PIC. In this study, we have used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of EMCV IRES-bound mammalian 48S PIC in a scanning-arrested closed state at the start codon. The EMCV IRES domains contacts initiator tRNA (tRNAi) and 40S head at the inter-subunit interface, which reveals an altogether unique mechanism used by viruses to capture host translational machinery for its protein synthesis. The tRNAi is held away from the 40S body in contrast to canonical cap-dependent translation while the domain I apical region of EMCV IRES mimics 28S rRNA of 60S to interact with 40S ribosomal head proteins-uS13 and uS19. The structural analysis account for numerous biochemical studies on Type 2 IRES and shows how Type 2 IRES interacts with 43S PIC to form 48S PIC. This study provides mechanistic insights for understanding EMCV IRES-mediated translation initiation, which could be extrapolated to other IRESs sharing similar motifs and factor requirements including type 1 viral IRESs.",

T h e NPC core is lined by intrinsically disordered protein chains called nucleoporins (Nups) which form a selective barrier where large macromolecules (cargoes) need to bind to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) such as Karyopherins (Kaps) to cross. Previous experimental results have suggested that not only Nups but Kaps, too, are important in the transport process of other NTRs/NTR-cargo complexes. In this work, we assess the role of Kaps in the transport of other NTRs (specifically, NTF2s) through the NPC, a process referred to as the \"Kap-centric transport model\". Here, using coarse-grained MD simulation we show that Kaps are able to direct NTF2s into the Nup meshwork, which leads to their increased flow. Our results also suggest that NTRs follow specific lanes inside the pore to maximize efficient transport.",

        "abstract": "One of the most critical steps in human reproduction is the selection of the dominant follicle when a single follicle is chosen from a large group of follicles to ovulate. Although this process involves complex hormonal regulation, the complete microscopic picture of unique selectivity remains unclear. We propose a novel stochastic mechanism for dominant follicle selection that incorporates the actions of the most relevant hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol. Our theoretical picture suggests the following sequence of events. As soon as the FSH concentration reaches the critical threshold, one of the available follicles is randomly selected, which immediately stimulates the production of estradiol, which, via a negative feedback mechanism, suppresses further FSH production, lowering its concentration below the critical threshold. This suppression limits the time window for the possible second follicle selection event, allowing only a single follicle to be selected. Based on this picture, a minimal quantitative theoretical model of dominant follicle selection is developed and analyzed using analytical calculations and computer simulations. Theoretical analysis shows how the interplay between different parameters that govern follicle selection leads to high selectivity. Our theoretical approach can explain some key known observations, providing a quantitative tool for analyzing biological reproduction phenomena.",

Recently approved RAS inhibitors represent a breakthrough but are limited to a specific KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutation and prone to resistance. Synthetic gene circuits offer a promising alternative by sensing and integrating cancer-specific biomolecular inputs, including mutated RAS, to selectively express therapeutic proteins in cancer cells. A key challenge for these circuits is achieving high cancer selectivity to prevent toxicity in healthy cells. To address this challenge, we present a novel approach combining multiple RAS sensors into RAS-targeting gene circuits, which allowed us to express an output protein in cells with mutated RAS with unprecedented selectivity. We implemented a modular design strategy and modeled the impact of individual circuit components on output expression. This enabled cell-line-specific adaptation of the circuits to optimize selectivity and fine-tune expression. We further demonstrate the targeting capabilities of the circuits by employing them in different RAS-driven cancer cells and provide evidence for their therapeutic potential by linking them to the expression of a clinically relevant output protein, which induced robust killing of cancer cells with mutated RAS. This work highlights the potential of synthetic gene circuits as a novel therapeutic strategy for RAS-driven cancers, advancing the application of synthetic biology in oncology.",

Repeat-domain docking strands overcome site-loss and reveal residual drift in prolonged MINFLUX 3D acquisitions that we correct with an algorithm exploiting time-correlated shifts of localizations around identified DNA origami sites. Following correction of residual drift the site precision, i.e. the scatter of localizations around sites, is [~]2 nm in all directions. Comparison of site precision from extended repeat-domain docking strands with site precision from standard short 8-10 nucleotide docking strands exhibits no detectable loss of site precision. By adding DNA origami structures to mounted biological samples we apply our approach to the imaging of the cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 in cryosectioned heart tissue. The data suggests that for these protein targets single domain markers with repeat domain docking strands may be directly used for residual drift correction, simplifying sample preparation and acquisition protocols.",

Here, we investigate nucleation in nonequilibrium hyperuniform fluids by projecting the full density-field dynamics onto relevant collective variables. We demonstrate that nucleation is governed by a nonequilibrium quasi-potential rather than the reversible work of formation. Surprisingly, because of the reduced hyperuniform fluctuations, the nucleation probability no longer separates into the usual surface and volume contributions. Furthermore, accounting for capillary waves reveals a clear breakdown of detailed balance driven by nonreciprocal dynamics. More broadly, our framework can be readily extended to identify nonequilibrium signatures in conventional active fluids.",

        "abstract": "We present a general hydrodynamic theory for active fluids, capable of describing living matter, that conserve center of mass or dipole moment. Imposition of dipole or center-of-mass conservation has been reported to yield peculiar behavior: breaking Galilean invariance in classical systems and potentially enabling exotic immobile excitations in quantum settings. In passive fluids, dipole conservation has been shown to cause a breakdown of linear hydrodynamics in all experimentally relevant dimensions. We show that introducing activity changes this picture: it can either restore or break linear hydrodynamics depending on spatial dimensions. Using our formulation, we predict universal dynamical scaling exponents for single-component active fluids in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions and find agreement with microscopic lattice-field simulations. Strikingly, for $d\\geq 2$, activity revives linear hydrodynamics, while for $d<2$ it leads to a breakdown; both cases flow to previously unexplored universality classes. Our results suggest that dipole-conserving active fluids are far more experimentally accessible than their passive counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Biological tissues have been observed to display emergent fluid-like properties, owing to physical interactions between cells. However, it remains unclear in general how these fluid-like properties affect tissue structure and function. Here, we are motivated by recent experiments in which cell aggregates were observed to behave as active droplets during collective migration along chemical gradients, or chemotaxis. To understand this process, we develop a minimal model of a growing thin active droplet driven by a self-generated chemical gradient. In broad agreement with the experiments, dynamic simulations reveal that chemotacting droplets exhibit proliferation-driven morphological transitions. To fully characterise these transitions, we perform a multiple scales analysis to show that the droplet dynamics follow a sequence of travelling wave solutions defined by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem parametrised by the slowly increasing droplet volume. Our analysis reveals that morphological transitions can occur continuously or through a discontinuous bifurcation. Further asymptotic analysis of the travelling wave problem reveals that these morphological transitions arise from exponentially small (\"beyond-all-orders\") asymptotic terms that originate from the rear and front contact lines. Moreover, we show that the nature of the transitions is fully determined by two key dimensionless parameters, which quantify the internal stress balance within the droplet and the strength of the coupling between the droplet migration dynamics and the external chemical field. Overall, our results provide a complete characterisation of the morphodynamics of a class of migrating active thin droplets, with implications in a range of biological systems where cell aggregates exhibit fluid-like behaviour.",

        "abstract": "While recent advances in AI have transformed protein structure prediction, protein function is also often strongly influenced by the thermodynamic and kinetic features encoded in its underlying free-energy surface. Here, we propose a framework to rationally modify these surfaces in order to control conformational transition rates, built on the Collective Variables for Free Energy Surface Tailoring (CV-FEST) framework, and validate it on point mutations of the miniprotein Chignolin. The framework relies on Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA) based collective variables (CVs) constructed from short molecular dynamics trajectories restricted to the metastable states, requiring only limited sampling within each state. Notably, the HLDA CV derived solely from the wild-type system already provides residue-level scores that predict whether mutations at specific positions are likely to accelerate or slow conformational transitions. Furthermore, we find that the leading HLDA eigenvalue associated with the derived CV, a quantitative measure of the one-dimensional statistical separation between folded and unfolded ensembles, correlates strongly with conformational transition rates across mutations. Together, these results show that kinetic effects of point mutations can be inferred from minimal local sampling, providing a practical route to the rational engineering of conformational transition rates without exhaustive simulations or large training datasets.",

        "abstract": "Engineering the free-energy surfaces (FES) of proteins and peptides is central to controlling conformational ensembles and their responses to perturbations. However, predicting how chemical modifications such as point mutations reshape the FES and shift conformational equilibria remains challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings. Building on the Collective Variables for Free Energy Surface Tailoring (CV-FEST) framework, we develop a computational approach that leverages short, unbiased molecular dynamics trajectories to guide mutation analysis. Using the ten-residue beta-hairpin CLN025 and a systematic library of its single-point mutants, we apply Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA) to extract collective variables from the conformational data. We find that the HLDA eigenvector learned solely from short wild-type trajectories provides residue-level insight into the propensity of mutations at specific positions to thermodynamically stabilize or destabilize the folded state. Extending this analysis, we show that shifts in the leading HLDA eigenvalue across mutants, a measure of changes in separability between the conformational ensembles along the HLDA coordinate, correlate strongly with mutation-induced changes in the free-energy difference between states, as reflected in melting temperatures. Benchmarked against Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics simulations, these findings suggest a promising and computationally affordable route toward guiding the engineering of biomolecular free-energy landscapes.",

This study develops a first-order linearisation of the incremental stress-strain response that isolates mechanical anisotropy from structural anisotropy using two independent orientation measures. The formulation enables both contributions to be quantified directly from macroscopic laboratory data. The method is applied to hollow-cylinder tests with systematically varied loading directions. Results show that both anisotropy components intensify as the stress state becomes more deviatoric; mechanical anisotropy is consistently stronger; and its relative dominance decreases with increasing deviatoric stress. Comparison with an isotropic hypoplastic model confirms that mechanically induced directional effects are captured even without fabric anisotropy. The framework offers a practical and physically transparent means for quantifying and comparing anisotropy mechanisms in granular materials.",

While conventional 20-nm-thick gold films break up into islands below 300 {\\textdegree}C, templated films not only remain stable but also become structurally refined after annealing above 600 {\\textdegree}C. This exceptional stability stems from a vdW-mediated crystallographic texture that reorganizes grain boundaries into a mechanically robust network.

        "abstract": "The aggregation of amyloid-forming peptides is a dynamic, complex process that underlies their diverse biological activities, from physiological functions to disease-associated dysfunctions. While the structure of fibrillar end-products is well-characterized for most amyloids, the heterogeneous and often transient oligomers, likely key in cytotoxicity, remain poorly investigated, especially for peptides with low-yield aromatic residues. Here, by exploiting and developing flow induced dispersion analysis in both peak and front modes, we demonstrate that intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence can be harnessed to quantify the conversion of diffusing monomers into non-diffusing oligomers and fibrils. We further characterize low-molecular-weight oligomers, and their size evolution from 2 to 10 nm over time. Importantly, we validate the robustness of our approach using two tryptophan-free and fast-fibrillating amyloid peptides, PSM$α$3 and hIAPP, known for their key roles in S. aureus virulence and type 2 diabetes respectively. Our results overcome the limitations of traditional biochemical and biophysical amyloid assays by extending analysis from large oligomers and fibrils to small heterogeneous oligomers, under near-physiological conditions. This study thus offers a new analytical framework, thereby filling a critical gap in amyloid research, to probe the early stages of aggregation, key in the design of alternative therapeutics for amyloid-diseases.",

        "abstract": "Oxytocin (OXT), a primitive nonapeptide known to regulate reproduction and social behaviors, is synthesized primarily in the hypothalamus and is secreted <i>via</i> hypophyseal-portal system of the posterior pituitary gland. In line with the premise that pituitary hormones, traditionally thought of as regulators of single targets, display an array of central and peripheral actions, we found that OXT directly affects bone and body composition. The effect of OXT on bone remodeling are physiologically relevant, as elevated OXT levels during pregnancy and lactation cause calcium mobilization from the maternal skeleton for intergenerational calcium transfer towards fetal bone mineralization. There is an equally large body of evidence that has established the presence of OXT receptors (OXTRs) in the brain through which central functions, such as social bonding, and peripheral functions, such as the regulation of body composition, are exerted. To purposefully address effects of OXT on the brain, we used RNAscope to map OXT and OXTR expression, at the single transcript level, in the whole female and male mouse brains. Identification of brain nuclei with the highest OXT and OXTR transcript density sheds further light on functional OXT nodes that could be further interrogated experimentally to define new physiologic circuitry.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) enable pervasive, regulatable protein interactions, yet predicting their binding affinities remains challenging because disorder permits heterogeneous interfaces and context-dependent recognition. Here we introduce IBPC-Kd, a curated dataset of 1,785 IDR-ordered protein complexes with experimentally measured dissociation constants (Kd), spanning more than six orders of magnitude in affinity and covering diverse IDR lengths and partner classes. Across this resource, we find that global interfacial shape complementarity is a consistent correlate of affinity, followed by the structural order of the partner surface and a systematic electrostatic asymmetry between IDRs and their binders. Local physicochemical patterning modulates binding in a partner-dependent manner. Guided by these observations, we develop IDRBindNet, a graph-transformer model that integrates protein language model embeddings with interface geometry and residue-level chemical context to predict dissociation constants from IDR-partner complexes. IDRBindNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on held-out complexes (R2 up to 0.911) while implicitly learning biologically relevant attention patterns corresponding to partner disorder and geometric fit. Notably, the framework generalizes through external validation on a set of recently reported de novo designed binders targeting the human surfaceome, showing encouraging concordance across nanomolar-to-micromolar affinities. Together, IBPC-Kdand the accompanying predictor IDRBindNet provide a quantitative framework for interrogating determinants of IDR recognition and for prioritizing candidate interactions for mechanistic and design studies.",

        "abstract": "Normative models are increasingly used to characterize individual-level brain deviations in neuroimaging studies, but their performance depends heavily on the reference sample used for training or adaptation. In this study, we systematically investigated how sample size and covariate composition of the reference cohort influence model fit, deviation estimates, and clinical readouts in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using a discovery dataset (OASIS-3, <i>n</i> = 1032), we trained models on healthy control (HC), subsamples ranging from 5 to 600 individuals, while varying age and sex distributions to simulate biases in reference populations. We further assessed the use of adaptive transfer learning by pre-training models on the UK Biobank (<i>n</i> = 42,747) and adapting them to the clinical dataset applying the same subsampling strategies. We evaluated model performance on a fixed HC test set and quantified deviation score errors, outlier detection, and classification accuracy in both the HC test set and the AD cohort. The findings were replicated in an external validation sample (AIBL, <i>n</i> = 463). Across all settings, model performance improved with increasing sample size, but demographic alignment of the covariates, particularly in age, was essential for reliable deviation estimates. Models trained directly within the dataset achieved stable fit with approximately 200 HCs, while adapted models reached comparable performance with as few as 50 individuals when pre-trained on large-scale data. These results show that robust individual-level modeling can be achieved using moderately sized but demographically matched cohorts, supporting broader application of normative modeling in aging and neurodegeneration research.",

Antifungal assays revealed substantial inhibition of mycelial growth and spore germination in Alternaria alternata and Fusarium oxysporum, with inhibition rates peaking at 83% and 82.79%, respectively, at a concentration of 120 µg/ml. Additionally, AgNPs showcased remarkable catalytic degradation of hazardous dyes methylene blue, methyl orange, and Congo red, achieving over 90% degradation within minutes, underlying their potential in environmental remediation. The catalytic reduction showcased not only the high efficiency of these nanoparticles in breaking down complex organic molecules but also positioned them as viable candidates for treating industrial effluents. The increased phenolic and proline contents in treated tomato plants suggest an enhanced stress response, potentially contributing to disease resistance.

To this end, it is advantageous to leverage advanced scientific computing frameworks for statistical analysis. One such framework is JAX, an emerging array-oriented Python numerical computing package for automatic differentiation and vectorization with a growing ecosystem for statistical inference and machine learning. We have developed cryoJAX, a cryo-EM image simulation library for building computational data analysis applications in JAX. CryoJAX is a flexible modeling language for cryo-EM image formation and therefore can support a wide range of data analysis downstream. By integrating with the JAX ecosystem, cryoJAX enables the development and deployment of algorithms for the growing breadth of scientific applications for cryo-EM.

        "abstract": "Understanding protein oligomerization in living cells is essential for elucidating cellular signaling and regulation, yet quantitative analysis remains challenging due to heterogeneous expression levels, dynamic interactions, and limited access to absolute protein concentrations. Here, we present a standardized, open-source framework for quantifying protein assemblies in living cells by integrating fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy imaging (heteroFRET and homoFRET) with molecular brightness-based concentration estimation and image analysis.  Using natural variants of a vertebrate GPCR, the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R-A and MC4R-B2), as a model system, we demonstrate how to discriminate monomers, dimers, and higher-order oligomers, extract inter-fluorophore distance distributions, and determine association constants under physiologically relevant conditions in living cells. Standard fluorescent protein tags report on proximity and oligomerization via Homo- and HeteroFRET. Association constants are quantified using the variable protein expression in living cells and the spectroscopy readouts. By high-content imaging we overcome the biological noise and attain data qualities comparable to conventional biochemical in vitro assays. Intensity- and fluctuation-based segmentation further extends the accessible concentration range within individual cells, improving affinity analysis robustness.  Our results establish quantitative image spectroscopy on living cells as quantitative tool for investigating protein-protein interactions under physiologically relevant conditions. All computational workflows are implemented in open-source software and are accompanied by detailed protocols and analysis scripts, enabling reproducible application and adaptation. Beyond GPCRs, this framework provides a practical and transferable methodology for quantitative studies on protein-protein interactions, mechanistic studies and drug discovery in complex cellular environments.",

        "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are domains within cells with distinct compositions, held together by intermolecular cohesion. They are implicated in a variety of cellular processes, and in vitro studies have revealed the molecular driving forces that underly their condensation. However, in vitro condensates do not capture essential features of cellular condensates. In particular, enrichment of proteins, quantified by partition coefficients, is often exaggerated in these simplified systems. We show that the addition of free amino acids and other small molecules to model condensates can bring their partition coefficients within physiological range. In this limit, where there is low biochemical contrast between condensates and their surroundings, we observe striking changes to condensate behavior. Such low-contrast condensates exhibit large fluctuations in shape and composition and show enhanced sensitivity to changes in their environment. These behaviors reflect dramatic shifts to their material properties, including interfacial tension, rheology, and chemical susceptibilities. We note remarkable similarities in these effects across seemingly unrelated two-phase fluid systems. To explain these trends, we reformulate classic models of critical phenomena in terms of partition coefficients. This framework simplifies application of theory to experiments with near-critical fluids and suggests new experimental approaches for assessing condensate physiology in live cells.",

        "abstract": "Protein condensates that form via phase separation typically become more viscous over time and can harden in a process referred to as \"molecular aging\". Several mechanisms have been identified for this phenomenon. Of these, the ones involving enhanced {beta}-sheet or -strand interactions are of pathological relevance since they have been associated with neurodegeneration. Although there is much understanding of biopolymer phase behavior, an inclusive thermodynamic framework that unifies phase separation and {beta}-sheet-based aging is lacking. We present a time-dependent, multi-component extension of associating polymer theory that describes phase separation and aging of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) capable of associating through local, reversible folding. The model shows how the Second Law of Thermodynamics applies throughout, whether phase separation precedes and encourages aging or, vice versa, whether the increase in \"stickiness\" during aging drives phase separation. Our calculations show how the time-dependence of the average valency of associating sites determines the aging kinetics and the development of viscoelastic properties of a biocondensate. The agreement between our calculations and the change in dynamics of condensates of  perfect repeat analogues of nucleoporin-98 not only validates the theory but also identifies these Nup98 variants as model systems for studying aging.",

The CG models were parameterized and validated using all-atom simulations of symmetric inner- and outer-leaflet membranes, as well as fully asymmetric MOM models. Bonded parameters were optimized through an iterative refinement procedure targeting atomistic bonded distributions. The CG simulations show good agreement with the all-atom simulation data and available experimental measurements in terms of the membrane thickness, solvent accessible surface area, lipid density profiles, and the outer-leaflet-induced lipid disorder in -mycolic acids at the inner leaflet. The model reproduces the temperature-dependent phase behavior of all-atom -mycolic acid membranes. Using this model, we demonstrate that PDIM localization, diffusion, and aggregation are strongly modulated by membrane fluidity and lipid composition, with enhanced translocation and clustering in liquid disordered environments. Our CG MOM lipid models provide a validated platform for large-scale simulations of mycobacterial membranes and enable mechanistic studies of lipid organization, membrane dynamics, and protein-membrane and membrane-drug interactions.",

        "abstract": "A common task in analysis of multidimensional NMR is the mapping of cross-peaks from one spectrum to another. In some situations, only a subset of coordinates of cross-peaks are to be matched such as in comparing corresponding dimensions of triple resonance assignment spectra. In other cases, the sample is perturbed in some way, and the task is to map corresponding cross-peaks that potentially change in any and all dimensions. This exercise is commonly done \"by hand\" and is both time-consuming and subjective. It is difficult for an individual to consider all possible interpretations of deviations between two multidimensional NMR spectra. Furthermore, in regions of high degeneracy, cross-peak matchings between spectra can be ambiguous. Ideally, a mapping algorithm should reflect a confidence of its matchings to indicate the reliability of proposed matchings and should do so while harmonizing all potential mappings in the spectrum. Critically, this process should be automated using criteria that are both well-defined, consistent and provide a measure of reliability. Here we develop a novel model describing the distribution of apparent deviations between cross-peaks of two multidimensional NMR spectra to random noise and true deviations to harmonize the cross-peak matching. Bayesian inference is employed to provide confidence estimates. The resulting algorithm (pHarmony) is tested in a variety of ways such as mapping between pairs of triple resonance spectra and between two- and three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectra generated by a fragment-based ligand discovery screen.",

Yet, under physiological conditions, the OXPHOS proteins operate as higher-order supercomplex (SC) assemblies, although their functional role remains poorly understood and much debated. By combining large-scale atomistic and coarse-grained molecular simulations with analysis of cryo-electron microscopic data and statistical as well as kinetic models, we show here that the formation of the mammalian I/III<sub>2</sub> supercomplex reduces the molecular strain of inner mitochondrial membranes by altering the local membrane thickness and leading to an accumulation of both cardiolipin and quinone around specific regions of the SC. We find that the SC assembly also affects the global motion of the individual ETC proteins with possible functional consequences. On a general level, our findings suggest that molecular crowding and strain effects provide a thermodynamic driving force for the SC formation, with a possible flux enhancement in crowded biological membranes under constrained respiratory conditions.",

We derive analytical expressions for the translational and rotational velocities of a prolate spheroid swimmer in terms of its Helmholtz decomposition modes and explore the effect of aspect ratio on these rigid body velocities. Then, for a given arbitrary swimmer shape of spherical topology, we investigate which slip profile minimizes the total power loss. A partial minimization is performed in which the direction of net motion of the swimmer is prescribed, followed by a global optimization procedure in which the best net motion direction is determined.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19299v1",
        "abstract": "The response of amorphous solids to a mechanical perturbation consists in an elastic and a plastic deformation. The latter is mediated by localized irreversible rearrangements associated with Eshelby-like quadrupolar singularities in the displacement field. It has recently been argued that a density of such singularities leads to an anomalous elastic behavior taking the form of screening effects, which goes beyond classical elastic predictions. Here, we reexamine this scenario using general theoretical arguments and a description in terms of an elasto-plastic model, which we compare with atomistic simulations of the canonical Eshelby inclusion geometry. We discuss the conditions under which a finite, i.e., nonvanishing, density of quadrupolar events is created by an imposed perturbation. We argue that, except when the perturbation is macroscopic, there are many situations in which the density of quadrupolar defects is zero in the thermodynamic limit. In these cases, we find that plastically active quadrupoles emerge in a region whose size generically scales as the spatial extent $\\ell$ of the mechanical perturbation. This mechanism leads to anomalous elasticity on a scale $\\ell$ close to the perturbation and to conventional elasticity beyond. The simulations of the elasto-plastic model reproduce the emergence of plastic quadrupoles in a region set by $\\ell$ and the associated renormalization of the effective shear modulus, but they do not exhibit the dipole-screening signatures reported in atomistic and experimental studies. Our analysis delineates the scale-dependent breakdown of long-wavelength elasticity in amorphous materials and suggests directions for incorporating anomalous screening into mesoscopic modeling frameworks.",

Classical descriptions of membrane mechanics that are rooted in equilibrium statistical mechanics and linear elasticity have yielded deep insights into membrane morphology and the role of thermal fluctuations on cellular function. However, real biological membranes operate far from equilibrium, continuously driven by active processes powered by energy consuming proteins. In this work, we employ a nonequilibrium statistical mechanics framework to model active membranes and derive analytical expressions for four fundamental properties that characterize their mechanical behavior: (a) the tension area relation, (b) the mean square amplitude of fluctuations, (c) correlation of normal vectors, and (d) the persistence length.

        "abstract": "The transport of soft viscoelastic gels through confined geometries underlies critical processes in biomedical, biological, and industrial systems. Here, we examine the translocation of a spherical microgel through a narrow capillary whose diameter is smaller than the equilibrium gel size. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in tandem with mean-field theory and mechanical analysis, we uncover a critical threshold diameter $d_c$ below which the microgel cannot enter, regardless of the applied pressure. This geometric limit emerges from the interplay between gel elasticity and its internal network connectivity, captured quantitatively by a graph-theoretic model. We construct a phase diagram in the parameter space of tube diameter $d$, applied force $f_g$, and gel stiffness $Y$ (Young's modulus), which delineates the regimes of successful translocation and mechanical arrest. Under negligible wall friction, gel mobility scales with the applied force; however, beyond a cutoff set by the network topology, progressive densification in the constriction stalls the microgel. Our results reveal the mechanical and topological determinants of soft-gel transport in confinement and provide predictive guidelines for engineering gel-based systems in microfluidics, drug delivery, and tissue-level filtration.",

        "abstract": "In regimes where inertia is negligible, the temporal evolution is governed by overdamped dynamics. This limit is particularly relevant in soft-matter contexts, such as polymers, colloidal suspensions, and processes occurring at the cellular scale. Being able to manipulate the dynamics of such many-particle systems would enable control over rate-dependent elastic responses, time-dependent material properties, relaxation processes, and perhaps the hydrodynamics of suspensions. In this work, we develop a framework for manipulating overdamped dynamics through local, physically motivated update rules. Our approach is inspired by ideas from physical learning and directed aging, in which microscopic parameters adapt autonomously to endow a material with a desired function. Using the Rayleighian formulation, whose minimization reproduces the overdamped equations of motion, we derive approximate directed-aging and equilibrium-propagation rules tailored to dissipative systems. To demonstrate these ideas, we study a disordered Maxwell material that behaves elastically at short times but flows at long times. By locally modifying the viscous damping, we show that one can tune the viscous Poisson's ratio and shape local mechanical responses. These results illustrate how materials can be trained to exhibit targeted rate-dependent elastic and viscous behaviors.",

The theory predicts a universal algebraic divergence of the susceptibility, $χ\\sim K^{-3/2}$, as the structural stiffness $K$ approaches the instability threshold. The exponent $γ= 3/2$ is consistent with the mean-field branching process universality class, thereby providing a theoretical rationale for the observed avalanche size exponent $τ\\approx 3/2$ in cortical dynamics without invoking microscopic equivalence. We identify adult cognition as a metabolically pinned non-equilibrium steady state maintained near the critical regime $Γ\\equiv K/α\\approx 1$ by continuous metabolic regulation, while pathological decline corresponds to a delocalization transition triggered by the violation of structural stability conditions.

As a result, the same experiments reported in literature produce widely divergent yields, limiting reproducibility and cross-study comparability. Here, we introduce a cargo-specific, quantitative framework for standardized MS2 VLP reassembly yield determination. We evaluate commonly used disassembly and post-disassembly processing methods and identify practical trade-offs between protein recovery, accessibility, and reproducibility. Reassembly yield is quantified using size exclusion chromatography calibrated against purified VLP standards, enabling robust, cargo-specific yield measurement. Using this framework, we apply a full factorial design of experiments to quantify the individual and combined effects of coat protein concentration, ionic strength, buffer pH, and molecular crowding on reassembly yield. The resulting statistical model explains more than 99% of the explainable variance and its linear fit to the experimental data indicates that optimal reassembly conditions extend beyond those tested to date. Protein concentration and ionic strength dominate reassembly yield, whereas pH and osmolyte concentration contribute more modestly within the tested ranges. Finally, we propose practical guidelines for standardized MS2 VLP disassembly, reassembly, and yield reporting, defining a transferable operating envelope for MS2 VLP reconstruction. While demonstrated here using a single nucleic acid cargo (tr-DNA), the framework is readily extensible to alternative cargos and coat protein variants.",

To assess solution quality and runtime performance, we benchmark the photonic solver against an exact classical cost function network (CFN) solver, which provides provably optimal baselines. For protein instances ranging from 493 to 943 variables, Dirac-3 attains solutions within 0.16-2.47 % of optimal energies. Empirical scaling analysis reveals a comparatively gentle effective runtime growth for the photonic solver over the measured regime, consistent with near-linear polynomial scaling, in contrast to the sharp super-polynomial growth observed for the classical baseline beyond approximately 1000 variables. These results suggest a near-term crossover regime in which hardware-aligned continuous-variable optimization may offer a practical promise for large computational protein design instances where exact classical methods become time-prohibitive.",

This mismatch induces pixel-size deviations in the reconstructed micrographs and modulates information transfer through a mismatch-induced modulation function (MIMF), which is characterized by phase reversals at specific spatial frequencies of the micrographs. These phase reversals, which vary with the defocus, cause destructive interference when merging micrographs, fundamentally limiting the resolution of SPA.

Recent controversies have focused on whether PSM3 propensity to self-assemble into unique amyloid-like cross- structures would underlie its high cytotoxicity. Here, by integrating Thioflavin T fluorescence, electron microscopy, and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that early soluble entities formed upon fibrillation - rather than mature fibrils - drive PSM3 cytotoxicity under near-physiological conditions. This mirrors the behavior of neurodegenerative disease related peptides, thus pointing towards a general mechanism of toxicity by amyloid forming peptides. Importantly, we elucidate the critical role of serum in this process: lipoproteins inhibit the formation of oligomeric and fibrillar entities, both in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, thereby drastically reducing cytotoxicity. We further reveal the uptake of such soluble entities in cells, where membrane interactions likely initiate and trigger cell death. These findings reconcile conflicting interpretations of PSM3 toxicity, highlighting the importance of the cellular environment in shaping peptide aggregation and biological function. By targeting such key virulence determinants, e.g. though the rational design of aggregation inhibitors, this study could open novel avenues in the quest for novel drugs against S. aureus infections.",

        "abstract": "CAPON (also known as NOS1AP) is an adaptor protein of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) that has been implicated in the progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, making it an attractive but largely unexplored therapeutic target. To identify small molecule CAPON modulators, we screened a library of 10,000 compounds for CAPON binding using affinity selection-mass spectrometry (AS-MS), which led to the identification of compound MA48 as a potential CAPON binder. Subsequent biophysical validation using microscale thermophoresis (MST) confirmed direct binding, with MA48 exhibiting a dissociation constant (Kd) of 11.9 {micro}M. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis combined with molecular docking was performed to elucidate key pharmacophoric features underlying the MA48/CAPON interaction. To determine whether MA48 disrupts the CAPON-nNOS interaction in a cellular context, we conducted a NanoBRET assay, which demonstrated that MA48 significantly inhibited this interaction in living cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that MA48 represents the first reported small molecule inhibitor of CAPON and provides a foundation for further development of CAPON-targeted therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "While gene expression in bacteria has been shown to be affected by near-zero or extremely high gravity, a mechanism has not been established to date. In larger organisms, gravity-sensing mechanisms usually rely on a dense body applying directional pressure which can be detected by the cell. Herein we demonstrate a means of observing the effect of gravity on cyanobacteria by differential expression of native pigments in response to both gravity and light. We observe that in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, the distribution of pigmentation within the cell, and across cell colonies, is regulated by combined directional sensing of incoming light, adhesion to a surface via extracellular matrix, and applied external force, including the normal force of gravity applied to the cell. Cells grown on a substrate orient their thylakoids on the cell faces proximal and distal to the substrate and locate both chlorophyll and phycobilins in both of these membrane regions; phycobilins are primarily targeted to the membrane region nearest to the light source, while chlorophyll is preferentially expressed in the region opposite the overall external force applied to the cell. The mechanism for distribution of pigments appears to be regulated by presence of polyphosphate bodies within the cell, and removal of polyphosphate negates the cells ability to sense external forces. Furthermore, colonial morphology is affected by application of force, with cells responding to the secretions of other cells along a gradient along the expected response to shading. These results represent a critical step toward understanding basal phototrophic regulatory mechanisms of light use and demonstrate the first known intracellular directional gravity response mechanism in a prokaryote.  Statement of SignificanceTo date, no directionally sensitive gravity response mechanism has been observed in any prokaryote. We demonstrate the first evidence of a directional response to external force in a cyanobacterium. This pigment distribution force-directed response interacts with the conventional response to directional light. Furthermore, the cells appear to be able to respond to the presence of other cells above them via intercellular signaling which is not simply due to shading by light.",

Termed density misfit barrier traps, these minima explain much of the poor fit between macromolecular models and experimental data relative to that of smaller molecules: not just high R factors, but distorted chemical geometry. We postulated that proteins exist as an ensemble of conformations that each have good geometry, but refinement algorithms have been unable to converge to them due to a tangling phenomenon arising from these traps. To demonstrate, a synthetic ground truth data set was generated, consisting of a 2-member ensemble with excellent geometry. A series of starting models, each trapped in increasingly difficult local minima, were prepared, a unified validation score defined, and an open Challenge issued. This Challenge inspired algorithms for escaping such traps, and new programs have been released that are expected to substantially improve the accuracy of macromolecular ensemble models.

        "abstract": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) biofilms consist of bacteria, an extracellular matrix (ECM) mainly made of curli amyloid fibers, phosphoethanolamine-modified cellulose (pEtN-cellulose), and water. While curli amyloid fibers contribute to biofilm rigidity, pEtN-cellulose contributes to their cohesion. This work explores the interplay between these fibers, and how their interaction influence biofilm structure and mechanical properties. We performed a multiscale analysis on E. coli biofilms grown using strains producing curli and pEtN-cellulose, and only curli and only pEtN-cellulose in co-seeded ratios.  Micro-indentation experiments, confocal microscopy, and cryo-FIBSEM 3D imaging revealed a composite-like behavior of the biofilm, where its mechanical properties depend on ECM composition and organization. Spectroscopic analysis of the extracted fibers showed that their biophysical properties are influenced by their pEtN-cellulose to curli ratio and assembly.  We propose that pEtN-cellulose swelling is contrained by its interactions with rigid curli fibers. The reference E. coli strain maximizes this effect by assembling a curli/pEtN-cellulose hybrid material at the sub-micron scale, where its composition, interactions, and architecture can explain biofilm emergent properties. This knowledge on microbial ECM assembly opens new avenues for engineering living materials, especially for the use of bacterial biofilms as a source of bio-sourced materials.",

        "abstract": "Understanding biophysical phenomena requires techniques that access biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales. Expansion Microscopy (ExM) is a sample preparation approach which achieves super-resolution spatial scales by leveraging osmotic forces in a swellable hydrogel to physically separate structures to distances larger than the diffraction limit of light. Yet, in traditional osmotic ExM only pre- and post- expanded samples can be imaged. Further, fragmentation, hydrogel deformation, and signal loss are common while requiring samples to be chemically fixed. Therefore, there is little control of the expansion, reproducibility can be challenging, and dynamics of biological samples at applicable temporal scales cannot be observed. Here, we develop Tensile Expansion Microscopy (TExM) to mechanically expand fixed and, notably, living cellular samples. Highly-stretchable and tough double network alginate- Ca2+/polyacrylamide hydrogels are expanded by tensile forces applied using an electromechanical iris expansion device during continuous imaging on a fluorescence microscope. We incorporate two-photon polymerized microscale fluorescent fiducial markers to track samples and distortion during expansion. The hydrogels controllably and repeatedly expand up to 3.3x with distortions less than 12 {micro}m across 1.3 mm2. TExM is first applied to fixed NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells with immunohistochemistry-stained microtubules, achieving super-resolutions of 100 nm. Then, TExM is demonstrated with living HeLa cells with internal fluorescent reporters showing increased cell size and cell-to-cell separation under 3.2x linear expansion. Overall, TExM allows for continuous, stepwise, and precise temporal modulation of lateral substrate strain, enabling real time monitoring of dynamics of both fixed and viable live cell processes at higher spatial resolutions. TExM can further investigate broad biophysical questions due to its compatibility with other analytical imaging methods that are sensitive to water or fixatives used in traditional osmotic ExM.",

        "abstract": "Single-cell dynamics during cell state transitions (CST) are highly constrained, enabling precise control. However, there are challenges in achieving a system-level understanding or extracting general principles for CST dynamics due to the complexity of gene-gene interactions. Here, we introduce a new perspective to deal with these challenges using Fisher information. We found that, during CST, single cells exhibit pronounced sloppiness: cell states are sensitive only to a few \"stiff\" parameters while remaining robust to changes in numerous \"sloppy\" parameters. Critical transitions coincided with changes in stiff parameters. Moreover, stiff parameters typically exhibited minimal fluctuations and low velocities, whereas sloppy parameters allowed greater flexibility. Together, these findings can be summarized by stating that transition paths approximately adhere to a principle of least action. By characterizing the low dimensionality and constraints of CST through sloppiness and action, our work thus introduces a new conceptual and computational framework for analyzing single-cell dynamics.  TeaserExcept when transitions occur, single-cell dynamics exhibit sloppiness, adhering approximately to a least action principle.",

        "abstract": "Theoretical ecology has traditionally equated persistence with the stability of a fixed equilibrium point. Here we argue that the primary threat to ecosystem persistence need not be the loss of stability, but instead the escape of the stable equilibrium to a negative orthant. In a realistic setting, fluctuations in interactions do not merely disturb abundances about an equilibrium but can displace the equilibrium point itself. We theoretically and empirically analyze such displacements of the equilibrium point in a complex community. Theoretically, we find that light-tailed fluctuations in species interactions, no matter how small, lead to a heavy-tailed power law $P(y)=1/y^α$ for the equilibrium abundance $y$ of a species. Remarkably, the exponent $α=2$ is a universal value independent of interaction structure, community size, and species. Empirically, our analysis of 34 species reveals a power law signal for most, with a median exponent $α\\sim2.56$. Next, we derive a formula for the critical noise, $σ_c$, beyond which the community experiences feasibility loss ``with near certainty''. We find that $σ_c(N)\\sim N^{-1}$, implying that larger communities are significantly more fragile to noise induced feasibility loss. Lastly, we define and calculate biologically measurable analytical metrics for both global and species-specific feasibility escape rates, and implement these metrics in dynamic simulations of 98 real world mutualistic and food web networks, to successfully predict their fragility.",

        "abstract": "Cells often divide under mechanical confinement, where surrounding structures restrict shape changes during cytokinesis. Although forces generated during confined division have been measured experimentally, it remains unclear how confinement geometry and mechanics determine the transmitted force. Here we develop a minimal mechanical theory of cell division under confinement. Modeling the cell as an incompressible volume bounded by an interface with effective isotropic tension, we show that confinement restricts the set of mechanically admissible furrow shapes. As the furrow radius decreases, it reaches it reaches a confinement-induced minimum. Beyond this point, further ingression does not alter the interface shape, and both pressure and axial force saturate. We analyze force and pressure in rigid, soft, and strong three-dimensional confinement and demonstrate that a single geometric mechanism underlies these distinct cases. After rescaling force and length by the appropriate geometric scale, cells of different size and surface tension collapse onto a single universal curve. The relevant length scale is the cell size for rigid and soft confinement, and the confinement size in fully enclosing three-dimensional confinement. In soft confinement, environmental stiffness and spindle-generated axial forces determine the operating force and pressure, while the geometric constraint fixes the maximal attainable levels. In summary, our results show that mitotic force transmission and mitotic pressure during cytokinesis are bounded by confinement geometry, with material properties and active forces selecting the operating point within these geometry-imposed limits.",

Thermodynamic measurements and imaging-based analyses further demonstrated that condensate stability and material properties can be rationally tuned through peptide optimization.

Biofilm-dwelling cells benefit from emergent soft matter physics that sculpts three-dimensional morphologies and osmotically absorbs nutrients. Although biofilms are modeled as viscoelastic gels, the physical origins of the phase transition underlying their conversion from groups of cells to living gels have not been systematically investigated. Here, we show that Bacillus subtilis biofilms use polymer composition to tune their physical properties and drive gel formation. Using imaging and water immersion experiments with matrix knockout strains, we demonstrate the complementary roles of two polymers in this developmental transition: hydrophilic poly-{gamma}-glutamate swells colonies by absorbing water and exopolysaccharides serve as effective cross-linkers, causing a sol-gel-like phase transition that imparts structural integrity. With matrix knockout co-culture biofilms, we independently modulate the production of each polymer and reveal a phase space of biofilm morphologies. Colonies that produce both polymers develop macroscopic wrinkles. A thin-film model predicts biofilm wrinkling from swelling-generated internal strain coupled to elasticity. The model reproduces the shape of our observed morphological phase diagram.

Across biological scales, turnover-mediated remodeling enables mechanical adaptation by continuously renewing internal structures under load. Despite extensive progress in this field, it remains to be established what closed-loop mathematical structure of mechanics-turnover coupling is sufficient to guarantee homeostasis and how the characteristic adaptation timescale emerges from this coupling. Here, we identify the minimal mathematical structure of closed-loop mechanics-turnover coupling, providing a unifying description of mechanically adaptive remodeling across scales. We derive an analytical expression for the adaptation timescale as a function of the coupling between internal mechanical parameters and turnover kinetics, enabling direct cross-system comparison. To isolate this structure, we formulate a dynamical model linking mechanics and turnover, and establish conditions under which the closed-loop dynamics exhibit integral action. Specifically, our model describes how deviations in the mechanical state modulate the turnover of an internal structural state, and the renewed structure feeds back onto mechanics in a negative-feedback direction, driving recovery toward a reference state. We define systems satisfying this structure as Feedback Adaptive Turnover-mediated Environment-Dependent (FATED) systems. As an experimental example, we formulate mechanical adaptation in terms of mechanically regulated actin turnover. With the generalization of this architecture, we evaluate cross-system consistency by comparing reported adaptation and turnover timescales across representative remodeling systems.",

        "abstract": "1.Space weather exerts profound effects on Earths technological systems, yet its influence on the terrestrial biosphere remains largely unexplored at the global scale. Despite decades of research on solar-terrestrial interactions, most studies have focused on technological and atmospheric effects, while potential influences on biological regulation remain largely unexplored. While local experiments suggest magnetic sensitivity in plants (Galland and Pazur 2005; Belyavskaya 2004), observational evidence for a planetary-scale vegetative response to geomagnetic disturbances is lacking. In particular, it is unclear whether weak and intermittent geomagnetic disturbances can leave detectable signatures in ecosystem-scale physiological processes.  Here, we analyze a decade of satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data alongside geomagnetic indices to isolate non-seasonal physiological anomalies. Using temperature-stratified cumulative correlation analysis and multivariate models controlling for radiative and hydrological drivers, we identify a robust, cumulative, and thermally gated association between geomagnetic activity and vegetation fluorescence.  We report a global-scale coherent modulation of photosystem balance, potentially inferred from the SIF757/SIF771 ratio, with recurrent geomagnetic disturbances, exhibiting maximal coherence under cold and moderate thermal conditions and weakening under Optimum and Warm Stress regimes. This response intensifies with increasing integration window length, indicating progressive physiological integration of repeated perturbations. Comparative analyses demonstrate that geomagnetic forcing is frequently comparable to or exceeds major climatic drivers in explaining fluorescence variability within biologically active regimes.  We propose a mechanism consistent with magnetic modulation of radical pair spin dynamics in iron-sulfur clusters and cryptochromes, potentially influencing reactive oxygen species generation and redox-regulatory adaptation. Our findings suggest that plants have evolutionarily co-opted geomagnetic variability as an informational signal, integrating it into existing redox-regulatory networks. Rather than a passive mechanical perturbation, the observed response reflects an evolved sensitivity that operates near physiological criticality--a hypothesis that opens new frontiers in understanding magnetosphere-biosphere coupling.",

        "abstract": "Opioid agonists such as morphine and fentanyl exert analgesic effects by binding and activating the {micro}-opioid receptor ({micro}OR), yet agonism of the {micro}OR causes a slate of serious side effects. {micro}OR-mediated addiction and respiratory depression are the major causes of the current opioid overdose crisis, largely driven by the explosion in illicit use of fentanyl, a potent opioid receptor full agonist. Given these serious side effects (and high resulting societal cost), molecules that act as analgesics with distinct mechanisms of action are of great interest. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the {micro}OR have the potential to avoid many off-target side effects of conventional opioid orthosteric agonists by enhancing the signaling properties of natural opioid peptide systems. We used a DNA-encoded chemical library screening approach to selectively discover active-state-specific {micro}OR PAMs. Two out of 3 selected prospective PAMs displayed the anticipated enhancement in agonist activity. The most effective of these compounds enhanced the activity of all orthosteric opioid agonists tested, including the native opioid peptide met-enkephalin. Little is known about the underlying dynamic basis of allosteric modulation of Family A GPCRs like the {micro}OR. To that end, we used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments to detail the impact that our novel {micro}OR PAM has on the dynamic activation behavior of a key region on the intracellular face of the receptor. Our results here provide both a new chemical scaffold that acts as a {micro}OR PAM and detailed pharmacological and dynamic insights into its mechanism of action.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n                  Smart microscopy is transforming life sciences by automating experimental imaging workflows and enabling real-time adaptation based on feedback from images and other data streams. This shift increases throughput, improves reproducibility, and expands the functional capabilities of microscopes. However, the current landscape is highly fragmented. Academic researchers often develop custom solutions for specific scientific needs, while industry offerings are typically proprietary and tied to specific hardware. This diversity, while fostering innovation, also creates major challenges in interoperability, reproducibility, and standardization, which slows progress and adaption. This article presents a collaborative effort between academic and industry leaders to survey the current state of smart microscopy, highlight representative implementations, and identify common technical and organizational barriers. We propose a framework for greater interoperability based on shared standards, modular software design, and community-driven development. Our goal is to support collaboration across the field and lay the groundwork for a more connected, reusable, and accessible smart microscopy ecosystem. We conclude with a call to action for researchers, hardware developers, and institutions to join in building an open, interoperable foundation that will unlock the full potential of smart microscopy in life science research.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\n                    The adult mammalian heart lacks the significant regenerative potential needed to cope with the massive loss of cardiomyocytes following myocardial infarction. Ultimately, irreversible cardiac damage leads to heart failure, which is associated with a poor prognosis. Given this, reactivating dormant regenerative processes in the injured heart represents an attractive therapeutic approach. When regeneration does occur, newly formed cardiomyocytes are derived from preexisting ones.\n                  \n                  \n                    METHODS:\n                    \n                      We aimed to identify novel regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation. In this context, the genome is transcribed for a large part into RNAs with little or no protein-coding potential. Among noncoding RNAs, long noncoding RNAs represent the most diverse class of molecules and are implicated in numerous epigenetic mechanisms, making them ideal targets for controlling cell identity and behavior. In this project, we developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify long noncoding RNAs that promote cardiomyocyte proliferation upon knockdown. Using a stringent selection pipeline, we identified\n                      Clipper\n                      , an enhancer-associated long noncoding RNA regulating the expression of its cognate protein-coding gene\n                      Lpin1\n                      in cis.\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    RESULTS:\n                    \n                      Clipper\n                      was found to control mitochondrial biogenesis via LPIN1 (Lipin1). Specifically, productive mitochondrial division, characterized by fission site positioning at the midzone of the mitochondrion, was stimulated by\n                      Clipper\n                      or\n                      Lpin1\n                      silencing. The process was associated with a change in mitochondrial bioenergetics, particularly decreased oxidative metabolism, reduced production of reactive oxygen species, and dampened DNA damage, creating favorable conditions for cardiomyocyte proliferation.\n                      Clipper\n                      knockdown in vivo following myocardial infarction stimulated cardiac regeneration in the damaged myocardium, leading to the restoration of heart function. Importantly,\n                      CLIPPER\n                      is positionally and functionally conserved in humans.\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    CONCLUSIONS:\n                    \n                      Our data identify\n                      CLIPPER\n                      as a promising therapeutic target for heart regeneration, acting through control of LPIN1-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis and cardiomyocyte proliferation.",
