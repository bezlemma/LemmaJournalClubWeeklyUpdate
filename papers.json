        "abstract": "Abstract\n                  Smart microscopy is transforming life sciences by automating experimental imaging workflows and enabling real-time adaptation based on feedback from images and other data streams. This shift increases throughput, improves reproducibility, and expands the functional capabilities of microscopes. However, the current landscape is highly fragmented. Academic researchers often develop custom solutions for specific scientific needs, while industry offerings are typically proprietary and tied to specific hardware. This diversity, while fostering innovation, also creates major challenges in interoperability, reproducibility, and standardization, which slows progress and adaption. This article presents a collaborative effort between academic and industry leaders to survey the current state of smart microscopy, highlight representative implementations, and identify common technical and organizational barriers. We propose a framework for greater interoperability based on shared standards, modular software design, and community-driven development. Our goal is to support collaboration across the field and lay the groundwork for a more connected, reusable, and accessible smart microscopy ecosystem. We conclude with a call to action for researchers, hardware developers, and institutions to join in building an open, interoperable foundation that will unlock the full potential of smart microscopy in life science research.",

However, simultaneously quantifying lateral molecular diffusion and vertical membrane fluctuations in live cells remains challenging. Here, we present dynamic metal-induced energy transfer spectroscopy (dynaMIET), which integrates metal-induced energy transfer with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to resolve three-dimensional membrane dynamics with nanometer axial sensitivity and microsecond temporal resolution. dynaMIET enables concurrent measurement of lateral diffusion and vertical undulations within a single acquisition. We validate the method using simulations and model membranes and demonstrate its robustness in living cells, applying it to the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear envelope. By capturing both molecular mobility and membrane fluctuations, dynaMIET provides a powerful, non-invasive tool for probing membrane mechanics and organization. This advance opens new avenues for studying membrane-associated phenomena in health and disease, including cancer cell mechanics, protein-membrane interactions, and organelle dynamics.",

Molecular simulations initiated from BioEmu ensemble capture active-to-inactive transitions in CDK2 and BRAF, two members of the serine-threonine kinase family, and elucidate how the disease-causing V600E mutation in BRAF drives population shifts among distinct metastable states relative to the wild type. Furthermore, we combined BioEmu ensemble with experimental cryo-EM data to construct all-atom conformational ensembles of biomolecules. In comparison to the AlphaFold2 reduced multiple sequence alignment (rMSA-AF2) approach, BioEmu-generated ensembles sample a broader conformational space for serine-threonine kinases but fail to capture conformational heterogeneity in several cases, including Glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1), a membrane transporter, and plasmepsin-II (PlmII), an aspartic protease. Systems where side-chain conformational heterogeneity governs protein dynamics such as cryptic pocket opening in PlmII or transitions between multiple metastable states in GlyT1; molecular simulations initiated from BioEmu generated ensemble do not capture the full spectrum of conformational heterogeneity. Overall, this study presents a straightforward framework for integrating generative AI based protein emulators with statistical physics to recover Boltzmann-weighted conformational ensembles at scale, while also highlighting critical limitations that necessitate careful, system-specific analysis when interpreting protein conformational landscapes.",

These compounds may have pharmacological effects, including antimicrobial, ion channel modulating, and antihypertensive activities. Our study aims to examine the transcripts from the venom glands of <i>Tityus paraguayensis</i>, focusing on identifying and annotating the genes expressed in these glands. A transcript encoding a potassium channel-modulating peptide was selected for 3D structural modeling, phylogenetic analysis, and interaction assessment. Initially, the scorpions’ telsons were dissected and analyzed using transcriptome sequencing. The data were then assembled and functionally annotated. The sequencing and assembly of the venom gland transcriptome produced a set of 37,283 transcripts, of which 523 were annotated as potentially related to venom components. Among the venom components, peptides that modulate sodium (8%), potassium (9%), and calcium (1%) channels, antimicrobial peptides (6%), antihypertensives (2%), phospholipases (1%), and metalloproteinases (29%) were identified, along with other compounds (44%). Specific highlights include the structural-functional analysis of four key peptides: TpNa3, a probable β-toxin sodium channel modulator with a βαββ structural motif; TpHyp1, a long-chain antihypertensive peptide that contains the conserved KPP motif; TpAP1, a short antimicrobial peptide with a low positive charge and an α-helical structure; and TpK8 is a potassium toxin that was previously partly identified (α-KTx). Molecular modeling and docking analyses showed that TpK8 binds with high affinity and stability, especially to the Kv1.3 channel, through specific interactions with the selectivity filter. These findings emphasize the extensive molecular diversity of <i>T. paraguayensis</i> venom, highlighting its potential as a rich and largely unexplored source of bioactive molecules. This makes it a promising target for developing new bioactive compounds for biotechnological and therapeutic use.",

        "abstract": "AA amyloidosis is a severe complication of chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by fibrillar protein deposition in the kidneys, leading to progressive organ failure. This study presents a mathematical model coupling SAA-HDL binding dynamics with renal amyloid aggregation kinetics to elucidate disease pathogenesis. Under normal conditions, Serum Amyloid A (SAA) circulates bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which acts as a molecular chaperone preventing misfolding. However, during chronic inflammation, SAA production exceeds HDL binding capacity, resulting in free SAA that undergoes renal filtration. The model calculates free SAA concentration from reversible binding equilibrium and incorporates renal filtration, mesangial accumulation, and conversion to amyloid fibrils through primary nucleation and autocatalytic growth mechanisms. A central contribution of this work is quantifying accumulated nephrotoxicity arising from AA oligomers, which inflict cumulative cytotoxic damage to mesangial and tubular cells over time. Because oligomers are continuously generated during ongoing aggregation, their toxic burden integrates across the entire duration of the disease. Combined nephrotoxicity, encompassing both oligomer-mediated cellular injury and fibril-driven mechanical disruption of renal architecture, therefore reflects not merely the current disease state but the full inflammatory trajectory of the patient. This cumulative damage defines renal biological age, a measure of functional deterioration whose portion attributable to accumulated nephrotoxicity is irreversible. Renal biological age is also path-dependent: two patients with identical present-day SAA levels may carry different renal damage burdens depending on the duration, timing, and severity of their prior inflammatory episodes. Sensitivity analysis reveals that HDL concentration and SAA cleavage rate are critical determinants of amyloid burden.",

Predicting cell response to different mechanochemical cues that are transmitted to the nucleus remains an open problem in the field of mechanomedicine. We developed a predictive modeling framework to examine how nuclear deformation on substrates with different nanotopographies influences nucleocytoplasmic transport and rearrangement of the nuclear lamina. Using the finite element method, we simulated nuclear compression by the perinuclear actin cap on substrates with arrays of nanopillars, modeling the nuclear envelope as a nonlinear elastic structure and coupling deformations to a biochemical model of lamin remodeling and nucleocytoplasmic transport. These simulations predicted regions of high nuclear envelope stretch adjacent to cell-nanopillar contacts, leading to maximized laminar stress on small nanopillars spaced by 4-5 microns. We then considered the effects on nuclear transport of YAP and TAZ and found that increased nuclear compression led to YAP/TAZ nuclear localization in agreement with previous experiments. Furthermore, the simulated force load per lamin was maximized on nanopillar substrates with high nuclear stretch. The magnitude of this load was modulated by the rate of actin cap assembly and the overall expression level of lamin A/C -- decreasing lamin content in the nuclear envelope led to a higher likelihood of rupture. We validated this prediction in subsequent experiments with lamin-depleted U2OS cells, establishing the central importance of lamin transport and microenvironment nanotopography to nuclear mechanotransduction.",

        "abstract": "Free-living unicellular organisms known as ciliates rely on fluid flows to perform essential functions. These flows emerge from the coordinated activity of thousands of cilia organized into arrays with highly diverse architectures. Despite the importance of mesoscale cilia organization for flow generation, the relationship between the architecture of the ciliary array and the flow function it performs remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the ciliary array in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia enables this organism to feed and swim simultaneously. Using expansion microscopy and high-speed imaging, we measure ciliary organization and kinematics, from individual beat dynamics to collective metachronal wave patterns. We find that the cell surface is partitioned into arrays with distinct spatio-temporal patterns that perform specific functions. In addition to the oral apparatus, there are two structurally different domains: a densely ciliated high-frequency beating region located anterior to the oral apparatus and a second domain covering the remainder of the cell surface where cilia are more sparsely distributed and slower-beating. Selective removal of each region results in impaired feeding or swimming, demonstrating the functional specialization of each domain. Together, our findings show that a continuous cilia array can generate flows that perform different functions by locally encoding different ciliary architectures. More broadly, this work highlights spatio-temporal ciliary patterning as a key determinant of array function and provides insight into how organization of ciliary arrays governs swimming and transport in biological systems.",

        "abstract": "Study Objectives: Chronotype, typically defined by the mid-sleep phase on free days, is often interpreted as a direct proxy for circadian phase. However, a fundamental paradox challenges this assumption: worldwide chronotype distributions show a heavy right skew, whereas circadian period distributions show a slight left skew. We investigated whether fast, noisy cortical processes in homeostatic sleep pressure dynamics could resolve this paradox. Methods: Drawing upon the classical two-process model of sleep regulation, we simulated how interindividual differences in sleep homeostasis (Process S), combined with realistic circadian period distributions (Process C), interact to shape chronotype variability. We introduce stochasticity into sleep pressure build-up to test whether homeostatic variance generates the empirically observed right-skew in chronotype distributions. Results: Exploring the parameter space reveals that stable sleep-wake cycles are constrained within physiological limits of entrainment in an Arnold tongue-like structure. While our simulations confirm a general positive correlation between intrinsic period and chronotype, the heavy right tail of the chronotype distribution arises from interindividual variability in homeostatic sleep dynamics operating near the unstable boundaries of entrainment. This mechanism preserves the individual-level correlation but inverts the population-level skew from left to right. Conclusions: Behavioral chronotype emerges from the nonlinear interaction between fluctuating homeostatic sleep pressure and a hierarchically entrained circadian system. We caution against inferring the intrinsic circadian period solely from chronotype, particularly in clinical contexts where accurate assessment of circadian rhythmicity is critical for targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "Linking the spatiotemporal dynamics of proteins in live cells to physiological functions is a fundamental challenge in biology and robust quantification of protein dynamics is a major step towards this endeavor. Single molecule tracking (SMT) has emerged as a powerful technique to investigate protein dynamics at the single molecule level in living cells. Most SMT analyses require familiarity with biophysical models and programming and the results from different analyses cannot be easily integrated. To mitigate these shortcomings, we developed QuantiTrack - a MATLAB-based SMT analysis software that can be operated from a simple graphical user interface. This provides a much-needed end-to-end solution where a user can load a movie, track single molecules, and perform a range of analyses. In addition to a detailed user guide with step-by-step instructions, QuantiTrack includes quality control metrics that can be used to systematically determine tracking parameters. As a practical example, we address by QuantiTrack a question relevant to hormonal therapy: How does the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a hormone-regulated transcription factor (TF), respond to treatment and washout of its cognate hormone. Hormone washout results in rapid (in minutes) downregulation of GR target genes to basal levels. We observe dynamics of the Halo tagged GR (Halo-GR) and by integrating several analyses, show that hormone washout results in a substantially lower bound fraction of GR, reduced occupancy in the mobility state associated with GR activation, and shorter GR dwell times. These analyses showcase QuantiTrack as a convenient tool for comprehensive SMT analysis for a wide range of biologists.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered, low-complexity regions frequently cooperate with folded domains to mediate protein-protein interactions, yet accurately describing these mixed folded-disordered systems remains challenging. To visualize these mixed folded proteins, experimentally guided coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations are often employed to extend the timescales required to capture the complex dynamics in play. However, the minimalistic nature of these approaches often compromises structural accuracy and can lead to inaccurate inter-domain interactions. Here we introduce backbone dihedral terms directly derived from NMR chemical shift data in CG-simulations to characterize the open state of a mixed-folded construct of the anti-aggregation chaperone DNAJB6 that contains a folded J-domain and a disordered GF linker. By tuning residue-specific backbone dihedral parameters to match NMR-derived secondary-structure propensities of the linker in CG-simulations, we generate conformational ensembles that yield accurate interdomain contact maps. In agreement with analysis of NMR relaxation data, the resulting ensembles show that even in the nominally open state the linker experiences motions that resemble those of the closed state driven by hydrophobic residues in GF. More generally we show that by expanding CG-simulations to allow them to capture both local and global structural properties, physically relevant interdomain contacts can be retrieved.",

        "abstract": "Microtubules are essential components of the cytoskeleton that support epithelial organization, polarity, and tissue morphogenesis. They are composed of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, each encoded by distinct genes that generate closely related but functionally distinct isotypes. Although several tubulin isotypes have been implicated in ocular development and disease, how isotype diversity is organized during corneal morphogenesis remains poorly defined. Herein, we use the developing chick embryo as a model system to investigate the conservation and spatiotemporal localization of tubulin isotypes during corneal development. Through comparative amino acid sequence analysis, we show that chick and human α- and β-tubulin isotypes are highly conserved at structural and catalytic domains, with divergence concentrated in C-terminal regions associated with post-translational modifications. To relate these molecular features to tissue-level organization, we performed a longitudinal immunohistochemical analysis of five tubulin isotypes across key stages of corneal development. We identify distinct and dynamic patterns of isotype enrichment along apico-basal and central-peripheral axes within the cornea, as well as isotype-specific redistribution during epithelial maturation and corneal endothelial differentiation. Notably, TUBA5/TUBA4A exhibits tightly regulated localization, including enrichment at the leading edge of migratory corneal stromal progenitor cells and within the maturing corneal endothelium. Together, these data establish the chick embryo as a conserved and tractable model for studying tubulin isotype diversity in the cornea, and more broadly across other tissues, and to provide a developmental resource linking tubulin sequence identity to spatially defined microtubule organization during epithelial morphogenesis.",

Japanese quail is one of the very small number of domesticated bird species whose wild forms are migratory.

        "abstract": "Membrane fusion is ubiquitous in myriad biological processes, including presynaptic neurotransmitter release, myoblast fusion, virus entry, and fertilization. It is often considered in the presence of fusogenic proteins, which mediate the fusion by pulling the membranes into contact to overcome the high energy barrier imposed by hydration repulsion. Here we uncover an alternative pathway: membrane fusion arising from electroporation induced by transmembrane potentials in absence of proteins. Using biased molecular dynamics simulations to carry out extensive potential-of-mean-force calculations, we show how electroporation of opposing membranes promotes membrane fusion via formation of an intermembrane splayed lipid and peripore stalk, without any protein involvement. We validate our mechanism by demonstrating experimentally, via video microscopy and second harmonic generation imaging of interacting giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), that GUV fusion occurs in the presence of transmembrane potentials but not in their absence. The magnitude of these transmembrane potentials is biologically relevant, prevalent in transient states near the surfaces of cell membranes, underscoring the potential importance of this mechanism in biological events.",

However, the single-cell mechanisms governing this migration remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the swimming characteristics of individual C. marina cells during day (light) and night (dark) phases. We observed a strong positive correlation between the length of the propulsive anterior flagellum and the cell's swimming speed. We discovered that the length distribution of the anterior flagellum is different during the day and at night. We also found that the beat frequency of the anterior flagellum was significantly higher during the day compared to the night. This resulted in faster mean swimming speeds during the light phase. To investigate the mechanism of length regulation, we tested the role of intraflagellar transport (IFT) using the IFT dynein inhibitor, ciliobrevin D. Treatment with ciliobrevin D induced a time- and concentration-dependent shortening of the anterior flagellum. This is the first pharmacological evidence to suggest that an IFT-like mechanism may actively control motile flagellar length in C. marina. These findings suggest that C. marina modulates its swimming speed through diurnal changes in both flagellar length and beat frequency, likely as an energy-saving strategy coupled to its DVM.",

        "abstract": "Amyloids, classically associated with neurodegenerative disease, also play important roles in infection and immunity. Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) from Staphylococcus aureus are amyloid-forming virulence peptides that contribute to cytotoxicity, immune modulation, and biofilm stability. PSM3 forms cross- amyloid fibrils and shares sequence and -helical self-assembly features with LL-37, a human host-defence peptide that forms non-amyloid -helical assemblies. Here, we identify RNA as a context-dependent regulator of their assembly pathways and biological activity. RNA consistently reduces LL-37 cytotoxicity toward human cells without compromising its antibacterial function, suggesting a host-protective effect. In contrast, RNA preserves PSM3 cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity over time by reshaping its assembly landscape, promoting liquid-liquid phase separation at low concentrations and stabilizing dynamic -helical intermediates. At higher RNA concentrations, both peptides transition into distinct aggregated states, amorphous for LL-37 and fibrillar for PSM3, correlating with divergent functional outcomes. The amyloid inhibitor EGCG abolishes the bioactivity of both peptides by redirecting assembly into non-functional aggregates, highlighting that activity depends on supramolecular architecture and reversibility rather than aggregation per se. Together, these findings establish RNA as an environmental regulator of -helical peptide assemblies and reveal phase transitions as tuneable determinants of peptide function, with implications for microbial virulence, innate immunity, and therapeutic intervention in infectious and protein-aggregation-associated diseases.",

Chiral acto-myosin flows that arise from active chiral torques have been previously identified as the driver of this LR asymmetric spindle skew. Here, we show that high amounts of Lifeact::mKate2, widely used to visualize F-actin, reverse the handedness of active torques in the cortex. We find that this results in reversed chiral acto-myosin flows during LR symmetry breaking, leading to mirrored 6-cell embryos and situs inversus nematodes.

In this study, we propose a novel machine learning framework, Bleaching-Excitation-Emission Photodynamics (BEEP) learning, that exploits multiple discriminatory features of fluorescent dyes to greatly expand the number of distinguishable objects in an image by integrating emission spectra, excitation variability, and bleaching dynamics into a unified multi-view, fluorescence unmixing approach. Our method is built upon a rank-one-tensor-based generalized linear model and leverages two biophysically grounded assumptions: consistent spectral and bleaching behaviors under fixed excitation, and invariant fluorophore abundances across excitations. We first extract excitation-specific spectral and bleaching signatures from reference images, and then use them to estimate abundances in complex mixtures. Experimental results on both simulated and real images of microbial populations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms conventional and partially multi-view methods, offering improved robustness and accuracy in highly multiplexed fluorescence imaging.",

Quantitative imaging of USAF resolution targets and histology muscle preparations demonstrated a resolution enhancement approaching theoretical limits and comparable performance to N-BK7 glass SILs. This enabled visualisation of features usually below the diffraction limit of low NA dry objectives at a fraction of the cost of otherwise required high-powered objective lenses. To demonstrate accessibility and translational potential, our workflow was taught in a practical tutorial of an international microscopy course, where non-expert participants successfully fabricated, characterised, and applied SILs within a single session, reporting high confidence in independent implementation.

In vertebrate organisms, CCJs present in stable epithelial tissues are maintained primarily by cell-to-cell protein bridges made of an adhesion receptor E-cadherin. CCJs are destabilized dur- ing Epithelial (E) to mesenchymal (M) transformation (EMT), an essential step in cancer metastasis, where cells switch states and acquire migratory features. An essential trigger for EMT is a cadherin switch process from E-cadherins with N-cadherin, another cadherin isoform. EMT proceeds through several intermediate states referred to as hybrid E/M cells. These states are characterized by mixed levels of E- and N-cadherins at the junc- tions and exhibit versatile cancerous traits that are more aggressive than cancerous fully mesenchymal cells. As a result, many such states have emerged as key targets in cancer therapy. However, development of a therapeutic design to counter the hybrid E/M cells has been limited by the absence of a comprehensive understanding of the mechanics and dynamics of hybrid E/M states. Here, we develop a physical model of CCJs as a non-equilibrium system composed of a variable ratio of E- and N-cadherins, considered as coarse-grained molecules driven by ATP-powered machinery observed at CCJs. Our model predicts a robust measure of strength of junctions that captures previous experimental observations, and reveals a minimal mechanochemical landscape of hybrid E/M states. We show the emergence of several groups of CCJ states in this landscape with variable adhesion strengths, many of which resemble different hybrid E/M-characteristics observed experimentally. Finally, we identify that a difference in mechanosenstivity of the two cadherin isoforms towards cytoskeletal forces could be why the hybrid E/M states come into existence.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a single-stranded RNA virus responsible for a wide range of respiratory tract infections, including those affecting the lungs, airways, and middle ear. Understanding its transmission dynamics remains essential for effective disease control. A bio-inspired stochastic delay model for RSV transmission is proposed and analyzed. The model’s qualitative properties including positivity, boundedness, equilibrium states, and the basic reproduction number are rigorously established through well-posedness theorems. Parameter sensitivity is also examined. To investigate the system’s stochastic behavior, numerical schemes such as Stochastic Euler, Runge–Kutta, and Euler-Maruyama methods are applied. However, these traditional approaches fail to fully preserve the dynamic characteristics of the model. To address these limitations, a stochastic nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme with delay is developed. This approach ensures non-negativity, boundedness, consistency, and unconditional convergence, overcoming issues of instability and divergence often observed in standard stochastic numerical methods. Comparative simulations demonstrate that the NSFD method reliably reproduces the true dynamic states of the model. The proposed stochastic delayed modeling framework enhances our understanding of RSV dynamics and provides a stable computational tool for analyzing complex biological systems. The findings open new avenues for exploring nonlinear stochastic processes in epidemiological and neurobiological modeling.",

        "abstract": "Demonstrating when and where proteins undergo conformational rearrangement remains challenging in molecular dynamics (MD) analysis, particularly for transient and localized motions. We introduce RMSX, a time-series extension of root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), and Flipbook, a general-purpose method for mapping simulation metrics onto structural, atomistic snapshots. Unlike traditional RMSF values, RMSX is performed over partitions of the original simulation – not its entirety. This simple extension allows RMSX to pinpoint not only the degree of fluctuation but also isolate when a significant motion takes place for any amino acid residue. Flipbook provides an engine for transforming time-series, residue-level data into salient, colored 3D structures. Flipbook can take in RMSX values, or other user-provided values, to see how they vary with time, coloring and scaling the amino acids according to those values. We demonstrate these tools’ utility on unbiased and steered MD simulations of ubiquitin, HIV-1 protease, and the bacterial adhesion protein SdrG. RMSX and Flipbook together form a streamlined, open-source suite for quantitative, high-resolution interrogation of biomolecular dynamics.

However, understanding the interaction of the different subdomains of endophilin and their abilities to sense and generate negative Gaussian curvature are yet unanswered questions, with significant implications for the mechanisms and regulation of unconventional endocytic pathways. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we demonstrate the synergistic remodeling capabilities of the NBAR remodeling unit, as well as its ability to sort to and generate membrane regions with negative Gaussian curvature. We find that the assembly of NBAR scaffolds at regions of negative Gaussian curvature facilitate membrane hemifission in dynamic bud formation. These insights provide an additional role for endophilin scaffolds in endocytosis, as well as emphasizing the importance of developing new ways to study negative Gaussian curvature.",

        "abstract": "Achieving controlled and directed motion of artificial nanoscale systems in three-dimensional fluid environments remains a key-challenge in active matter, primarily due to the prevailing thermal fluctuations that rapidly randomize the particle trajectories. While significant progress has been made with micrometer-sized particles, imparting sufficient mechanical energy, or self-propulsion, to nanometer-sized particles to overcome Brownian diffusion and enable controlled transport remains a major issue for emerging applications in nanoscience and nanomedicine. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating the fuel-free, reversible, and tunable active behavior of gold-silica (Au-SiO2) Janus nanoparticles (radius R=33 nm) induced by optical excitation. Using single particle tracking, we provide direct experimental evidence of self-thermophoresis, clearly distinguishing active motion from thermal noise. These light-driven Janus nanoparticles constitute a minimal yet robust photothermal system for investigating active matter and its manipulation at the nanoscale.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the dynamics of a dense raft of millimeter-sized granular particles at a vertically vibrated air-water interface, which displays a rich set of patterns and particle dynamics as we vary the vibration amplitude, frequency, and particle packing fraction. While the classical parametric instability with standing waves still occurs over a certain parameter space, the measured wave dispersion relations indicate an increasing role in the raft's emerging elasticity at higher packing fractions, which induces a decrease in the effective surface tension and an increase in an out-of-plane bending modulus. At higher vibration frequencies and lower amplitudes, we also identified a regime without standing waves in which individual particles exhibit thermal-like motion and transition from diffusive to sub-diffusive transport as the packing fraction increases. Glassy behaviors such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity in particle dynamics occur as well, which is analogous to supercooled liquids. When the vibration amplitude is increased starting in this supercooled regime, a large cavity eventually forms inside the raft with its size and shape related to the vibration frequency and the injected vibration energy. The cavitation results in the coexistence of free surface water waves inside the cavity and thermal-like particle motion in the raft.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17521v1",
        "abstract": "Many biological microswimmers can modulate their swimming gait to achieve directional control of motility, especially when performing steering towards specific directional cues. This can be achieved without the need for obvious morphological or structural asymmetries in the form of the organism, or in the number or organisation of propulsion-generating appendages such as cilia. In this work, we identify and validate a core principle of asymmetric turning in biflagellate microswimmers: propulsive forces interact constructively to drive translation whilst interacting destructively to drive rotation. We explore the ramifications of this tunable biflagellar swimming mechanism across a range of systems, from a simple, back-of-the-envelope model to a detailed computational representation of an exemplar swimmer. This leads to a markedly general quantitative relation between key drivers of asymmetry, such as ciliary beat frequency, and the curvature of emergent trajectories. We discuss how the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which actuates its two cilia in a symmetric breaststroke for forward swimming, may exploit this feature for phototaxis. Finally, we validate our predictions in a Chlamydomonas-inspired robophysical model, implementing closed-loop control to achieve phototactic turning.",

        "abstract": "Brownian motion provides access to hydrodynamic properties of nanoscale objects independent of their optical resolvability. Here, we present a diffusion-based approach to infer effective particle size distributions of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), consisting of a magnetic core and a polystyrene shell, in a regime where direct geometric sizing is limited by optical diffraction. Using multi-particle tracking microscopy, we analyze the Brownian dynamics of MNPs grafted with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of varying contour length under low-salt conditions. A physically motivated model is introduced that relates dsDNA contour length to an effective hydrodynamic diameter via an attenuated corona description. The measured diffusion coefficient distributions exhibit a systematic and monotonic dependence on dsDNA length in quantitative agreement with the model. While the tracked objects are predominantly dsDNA-mediated agglomerates rather than isolated nanoparticles, clustering does not obscure the length-dependent signal. Instead, the dsDNA corona determines the hydrodynamic scaling, whereas agglomeration mainly introduces an offset and distribution broadening. These results demonstrate that Brownian dynamics enables robust readout of biomolecular length scales even far below the optical resolution limit. The distribution-based approach is inherently tolerant to polydispersity and aggregation, making diffusion-based tracking a simple and promising strategy for future biotechnological and biomedical assays.",

        "abstract": "Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.",

        "abstract": "The stochastic dynamics of flagellar beating for micro-swimmers, such as flagellated cells, sperms and microalgae, is dominated by a feedback mechanism between flagellar shape and the rate of activation/de-activation of the $N \\gg 1$ driving molecular motors. In the context of the so-called rigid filament models, where the axoneme is described by a single degree of freedom $X(t)$, we investigate the effect of direct coupling between the activity dynamics of adjacent motors, parametrized by $K \\ge 0$. A functional Fokker-Planck equation for $X$ and the state of the $N$ motors is obtained. In the limit of small coupling $K \\ll 1$, we derive a system of equations governing the dynamics of the Fourier modes of the active motor density, obtaining estimates for several observables and the fluctuations' quality factor $Q$. For larger $K$ we resort to numerical simulations. The effect of introducing the coupling $K>0$ is to increase characteristic times and the beating period. Moreover at large $K$s the limit cycle becomes bi-stable, with abrupt avalanches of the motor dynamics. Increasing $K$ is similar to what observed in the case $K=0$ when the confining elastic force is strongly reduced. The quality factor of fluctuations has a non-monotonic behavior: it first increases with $K$, then decreases. This is accompanied by the reduction and eventual disappearance of regions where the fraction of activated motor is nor $0$ neither $1$.",

The two leading hypotheses are organic radical pairs in cryptochrome flavoproteins and crystals of inorganic magnetic minerals such as magnetite. Here, we propose a magnetoreception mechanism that combines radical pair chemistry with magnetite nanoparticles. Instead of directly detecting the tiny dependence of a radical pair reaction on the direction of the Earth’s (~50 μT) magnetic field, this hybrid sensor uses a magnetic particle to amplify the Earth’s field. Directional information is thereby encoded in the response of nearby radical pairs to the intensity of a much stronger (~5 mT) magnetic field. The result is a magnetoreceptor with potentially 10 to 100-fold greater sensitivity than afforded by radical pairs alone.",

In this study, we delineate the consequences of a mutation located at a site distal to the functional region in a promiscuous acyl-CoA binding domain. A W86A mutation at a distal C-terminal segment induces two-stage noncooperative unfolding in an otherwise cooperatively unfolding protein, with the mutant exhibiting properties of a molten-globule with large equilibrium fluctuations at 310 K. Under the same conditions, NMR reveals a fourfold increase of a slow-exchanging alternate conformation in the W86A mutant, relative to the wild-type. These manifest as altered dynamic and thermodynamic coupling patterns promoting significant conformational excursions of helix 1, thus stabilizing an intermediate involving unfolded or undocked helix 1. The nonnative interactions mediated by helix 1, in turn, partially occlude the ligand-binding pocket influencing function in a chain-length-dependent manner. Further, the two-stage unfolding switches to a single transition in the W86A mutant in the presence of the ligand while simultaneously suppressing the population of the alternate conformation. Our results provide insights into how mutations could trigger long-range effects through modulation of the native ensemble properties, and the uniquely interconnected nature of the underlying molecular mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Controlling flow-induced segregation in a granular mixture is highly relevant to many industrial settings. To enhance mixing or promote segregation, the continuous gravity flow of a bidisperse granular mixture through a series of narrow vertical channels with exit slots is investigated. The bidisperse mixture is composed of two different sizes of particles, but of the same density. In dense flow, segregation occurs, leading to formation of bands. The bands of large particles appear at a distance away from the walls. This finding is in contrast to that in shear-driven segregation in a dense flow where large particles segregate towards the walls. Using a phenomenological model, it has been shown that rolling and bouncing induced segregation is the dominant mechanism. When cylindrical inserts are placed to modify flow patterns, that significantly influences segregation patterns. The symmetrical placement of a cylindrical insert close to the exit slot vanishes the bands and enhances mixing. However, with two inserts placed symmetrically and close to the exit slot, the degree of segregation in the reverse direction is greatly enhanced compared to that without insert. In the former, small particles accumulate in thin regions adjacent to the walls, and large particles comprise the bulk of the domain and the flowing stream. The heap formation above the insert in a narrow channel, when the insert is close to the exit, enhances mixing in one configuration, whereas it amplifies reverse segregation in the other.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17026v1",
        "abstract": "Shifting the point dipole from the center of a Stockmayer particle is a simple geometric modification that has been explored previously, yet its implications for liquid structure, dielectric response, and phase behavior remain incompletely understood. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with analytical theory to provide a unified physical interpretation of how dipole displacement reshapes microscopic correlations and propagates to macroscopic thermodynamic properties. We show that dipole shifting breaks the fore-aft symmetry of the local electrostatic field, producing only modest changes in radial packing but strong alterations in angular structure within the first solvation shell. Enhanced alignment near the dipole head is accompanied by frustrated orientational correlations near the tail, leading to broader angular distributions and a shift away from axial configurations at strong coupling. These structural asymmetries weaken cooperative ordering and result in a systematic reduction of the dielectric constant, despite locally stronger interactions. For large shifts, the dielectric response approaches the Debye limit, indicating effective suppression of dipole-dipole correlations. The same geometric frustration governs vapor-liquid equilibria: while increasing dipole strength raises the critical temperature, even modest shifts disrupt the highly polarized liquid states that emerge at strong coupling and can suppress ferroelectric-like ordering. Predictions from a reparameterized COFFEE theory capture these trends within its domain of validity, highlighting the direct connection between local orientational structure and macroscopic observables. Overall, this work demonstrates that dipole location, not only magnitude, provides a powerful control parameter in dipolar fluids and offers a clear framework for understanding geometric frustration in electrostatic liquids.",

        "abstract": "Goal-directed movements can fail due to errors in our perceptual and motor systems. While these errors may arise from random noise within these sources, they also reflect systematic motor biases that vary with the location of the target. The origin of these systematic biases remains controversial. Drawing on data from an extensive array of reaching tasks conducted over the past 30 years, we evaluated the merits of various computational models regarding the origin of motor biases. Contrary to previous theories, we show that motor biases produced by human participants do not arise from systematic errors associated with the sensed hand position during motor planning or from the biomechanical constraints imposed during motor execution. Rather, motor biases are primarily caused by a misalignment between eye-centric and body-centric representations of position. This model can account for motor biases across a wide range of contexts, encompassing movements with the right versus left hand, finger versus hand movements, visible and occluded starting positions, as well as before and after sensorimotor adaptation.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the interplay between biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and solute transport in Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO) using a theory of porous media-based multiphysics computational model, aiming to elucidate mechanisms behind variable treatment outcomes. Methods: We developed a multiphysics model of the retina within a porous media framework. The model integrates OCT-derived geometry, vascular leakage, retinal biomechanics (including M&uumlller cell fibre architecture), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function, and anti-VEGF transport. We simulated oedema development and therapeutic response by varying vascular leakage, RPE pumping, and M&uumlller cell orientation. Results Model validation showed that active RPE pumping is essential for maintaining retinal dehydration. Our simulations revealed a critical trade-off related to M&uumller cell architecture: the physiological `z-shaped' orientation protects against oedema but impedes anti-VEGF drug delivery to leaky vessels. In contrast, a pathological, vertical M&uumlller cell alignment increases oedema susceptibility but allows for a faster therapeutic response due to improved drug diffusion. Conclusions: M&uumlller cell orientation presents a trade-off between biomechanical protection and therapeutic efficacy, offering a novel mechanistic explanation for the variable patient responses to anti-VEGF therapy observed clinically. This in-silico framework is a powerful tool for dissecting DMO pathophysiology and has the potential to guide the development of personalised treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial fluoride channels (Fluc) are exceptional in their ability to conduct fluoride ions at rapid rates while maintaining extraordinary selectivity, an unusual property among anion transporters. Fluc achieves this through an antiparallel homodimeric assembly that forms two asymmetric ion-conduction pores and hosts a centrally bound sodium ion of previously uncertain function. Despite extensive structural characterization, the molecular basis for Fluc's dual-pore asymmetry, transport efficiency, and sodium involvement has remained unresolved. Here, we performed long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations under electrophysiological conditions to elucidate the mechanisms of fluoride translocation through each pore. Our results reveal two distinct conduction modes: Pore I operates via the Channsporter mechanism, characterized by single-ion transport; while Pore II follows the Multi-ion mechanism in which paired fluoride ions exploit electrostatic repulsion to achieve faster sequential translocations. These findings demonstrate that structural asymmetry gives rise to mechanistic specialization within the same homodimeric protein. We further propose that the central sodium ion serves as a dynamic cofactor in fluoride transport, coupling its vertical oscillation to fluoride movement in a pore-dependent manner. Together, our results establish a unified model of asymmetric dual-pore conduction in Fluc and introduce a broader paradigm in membrane transport biology, one where inherent structural asymmetry enables divergent yet coexisting mechanisms of ion conduction.",

Templating underlies DNA replication, RNA transcription and protein translation, underpinning the molecular basis of heredity, evolution, and biological function, and allowing staggering complexity to arise from simple building blocks. It has hitherto been challenging to emulate templating without highly evolved enzymes, largely due to product inhibition of catalytic turnover, which is a major challenge for templated dimerization and prohibitive for longer products. We present an enzyme-free DNA-based templated dimerization reaction enabled and controlled by a fuel strand that actively displaces the product from the template only once dimerization is complete, overcoming product inhibition. We systematically investigate design variants to optimise catalytic turnover, and demonstrate information propagation through the action of distinct templates that assemble specific products from the same pool of building blocks. We also show that the fuel represents an input by which the templating can be controlled, allowing the coupling of catalytic turnover to the output of upstream DNA circuitry.",

        "abstract": "Many physiological processes rely on cellular communication through ligand mediated signalling, where ligands secreted by cells diffuse through the extracellular space and bind to receptors to trigger downstream responses. Although reaction diffusion models capture these dynamics, parameter calibration often lags behind model development due to limited data that reflect the biological microenvironment and the lack of a unified framework for integrating such data into mechanistic models. We propose that single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics provide a rich, abundant, and underused source of information for calibrating such models at tissue scale. We develop a computational pipeline that integrates these data to infer model parameters, combining finite volume solvers with bioinformatics preprocessing, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), and gradient based optimization. Using two open source human skin datasets as case studies, we calibrate parameters governing the isoforms of Transforming Growth Factor Beta, a key regulator of tissue repair and fibrosis, and compare the resulting spatial concentration fields with local cell type distributions. Benchmarking on synthetic datasets helps evaluate the inference accuracy and shows the benefits of combining ABC with gradient based methods. Overall, the pipeline provides a flexible and rigorous approach for calibrating tissue level mechanistic models using modern transcriptomics data.",

While local experiments suggest magnetic sensitivity in plants, observational evidence for a planetary-scale vegetative response to geomagnetic disturbances is lacking. Here, we analyze a decade of satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data alongside geomagnetic indices to isolate non-seasonal physiological anomalies. Using temperature-stratified cumulative correlation analysis and multivariate models controlling for radiative and hydrological drivers, we identify a robust, cumulative, and thermally gated association between geomagnetic activity and vegetation fluorescence. We report a global synchronization of photosystem stoichiometry, inferred from the SIF757/SIF771 ratio, with recurrent geomagnetic disturbances, exhibiting maximal coherence under cold and moderate thermal conditions and weakening under optimal and heat-stress regimes. This response intensifies with increasing integration window length, indicating progressive physiological integration of repeated perturbations. Comparative analyses demonstrate that geomagnetic forcing systematically outperforms major climatic drivers in explaining fluorescence variability within biologically active regimes. We propose a mechanism consistent with magnetic modulation of radical pair spin dynamics in iron-sulfur clusters and cryptochromes, potentially influencing reactive oxygen species generation and redox-regulatory adaptation. Our findings suggest that plants have evolutionarily co-opted geomagnetic variability as an informational signal, integrating it into existing redox-regulatory networks.

We observe that the magnetic field effect is positive at low magnetic fields, reaches a maximum positive value near 1 mT, and then decreases, reversing sign at approximately 2 mT. Furthermore, the effect starts to plateau above approximately 70 mT, with a decreased sensitivity of fluorescence changes to magnetic fields above this range.

        "abstract": "Biophysical properties play central roles in cellular function by controlling the diffusion and spatial organization of biomolecules. Because bacteria lack a nuclear membrane, biophysical measurements are often averaged over the entire cell. However, the nucleoid environment is distinct from that of the surrounding cytoplasm, and averaging also ignores local characteristics within the nucleoid. Here, we developed a microrheology framework to quantitatively characterize the bacterial nucleoid and investigate the interplay of its physical properties with cellular processes. We combined single-particle tracking of a genetically encoded protein probe and three-dimensional (3D) Brownian dynamics simulations to separate the nucleoid from the cytoplasm and specifically measure nucleoid accessibility and viscosity. We found that the nucleoid viscosity is 2.5-fold higher than the cytoplasmic viscosity, and that both viscosity and accessibility change systematically across growth phases and the cell cycle. Inhibiting transcription or translation produces opposite changes in nucleoid viscosity in exponential versus stationary phase cells, indicating that the regulation of nucleoid viscosity is sensitive to the underlying biomolecular composition, crowding, and spatial organization. Using Hi-C assays, we further show that changes in nucleoid viscosity may occur without detectable alterations in genome organization, which suggests that nucleoid mechanics provide an independent regulatory mechanism. Spatially, viscosity differences are more pronounced between the nucleoid core and periphery than between genomic locations, and the periphery-core contrast correlates with the coupling of transcription, translation, and membrane insertion. Together, these results indicate that the bacterial nucleoid is a dynamic, heterogeneous viscoelastic environment in which actively regulated biophysical properties may help coordinate multiple cellular processes and provide a physical layer of control that complements canonical biochemical regulation.",

        "abstract": "Under stable growth conditions, bacteria maintain cell size homeostasis through coordinated elongation and division. Changes in nutrient availability perturb these mechanisms, resulting in dynamic regulation of the target cell size. Using microscopy imaging and mathematical modeling, we studied how bacterial cell volume changes over the population growth curve and found that Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, in stationary phase, exhibit similar cell volume distributions irrespective of growth media. Resuspending cells in rich media resulted in a transient increase in cell volume to a media-dependent maximum cell volume after $$\\approx$$ 2h before decreasing to the stationary phase cell size. Interestingly, stabilizing the growth phase through continuous fresh media supply sustained the size distribution. In poor media conditions, cell volume changed minimally over the growth curve, but cell width was markedly decreased. This cell volume dynamics along the growth curve can be related to a similar increase and decrease dynamics of the ratio between cell density ($$\\text{OD}_{600}$$) and cell numbers (CFU). We developed a simple mathematical modeling framework that predicted a time-varying division rate needed to capture the dynamics of the mean cell size across media conditions. The proposed analysis can be used for comparison of cell size regulation mechanisms across dynamic environments when single-cell tracking is not possible.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid formation, typically associated with neurodegeneration, can also serve essential biological functions. RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases assemble functional amyloids via their RHIM domains to drive necrosome formation and necroptosis. Here, we systematically map the sequence-function relationship of these domains using deep mutagenesis combined with massively parallel assays that directly report on amyloid nucleation and necroptotic signaling. Analysis of ~3,000 mutations across RIPK1 and RIPK3 reveals that both proteins rely on a conserved aliphatic tetrad to nucleate amyloids, but diverge mechanistically: RIPK3 nucleation is largely driven by this core interface, whereas RIPK1 requires a second aliphatic surface to achieve efficient nucleation. Cross-species comparisons with mutational atlases from mouse RIPKs show conservation of these principles, underscoring their evolutionary selection. Strikingly, functional outcomes depend on finely balanced nucleation: variants that either reduce or enhance amyloid formation impair necroptosis. Consistently, human population genetics indicates that such variants are extremely rare, suggesting evolutionary optimization of the RHIM domain at a sweet-spot of amyloid propensity required for signaling. By linking quantitative mutational landscapes to functional amyloid assembly, this work uncovers how evolution has tuned the amyloid propensity of RIPKs to enable robust cell death signaling. These insights not only advance our understanding of amyloid biology but also provide a framework for therapeutic modulation of necroptosis and for engineering synthetic amyloids with tailored activities.",

        "abstract": "Adhesion of spherical nanoparticles or virus-like particles to membranes can lead to membrane tubules in which linear chains of adhering particles are cooperatively wrapped by the membrane. This cooperative wrapping of spherical particles in tubules is energetically favourable compared to the individual wrapping of the particles because of a favourable interplay of bending and adhesion energies in the contact regions in which the membrane detaches from the particles, and because a particle in a tubule has two such contact regions in the membrane necks that connect the particle to the neighbouring particles, whereas an individually wrapped particle has only one contact region to the surrounding membrane. The energetic gain of cooperative wrapping strongly depends on the range of the particle-membrane adhesion potential, which determines the size of the contact regions. At sufficiently large adhesion energies for wrapping, the energy gain {Delta}E per particle is only weakly affected by the membrane tension {tau} as long as the characteristic length ({kappa}/{tau})1/2 of the membranes with bending rigidity {kappa} is clearly larger than the contact regions. For large particle adhesion energies at which the particles are fully wrapped, however, {Delta}E can be limited by the minimum possible radius of the membrane necks, depending on the adhesion potential range.",

The CG models were parameterized and validated using all-atom simulations of symmetric inner- and outer-leaflet membranes, as well as fully asymmetric MOM models. Bonded parameters were optimized through an iterative refinement procedure targeting atomistic bonded distributions. The CG simulations show good agreement with the all-atom simulation data and available experimental measurements in terms of the membrane thickness, solvent accessible surface area, lipid density profiles, and the outer-leaflet-induced lipid disorder in -mycolic acids at the inner leaflet. The model reproduces the temperature-dependent phase behavior of all-atom -mycolic acid membranes. Using this model, we demonstrate that PDIM localization, diffusion, and aggregation are strongly modulated by membrane fluidity and lipid composition, with enhanced translocation and clustering in liquid disordered environments. Our CG MOM lipid models provide a validated platform for large-scale simulations of mycobacterial membranes and enable mechanistic studies of lipid organization, membrane dynamics, and protein-membrane and membrane-drug interactions.",

The discrepancy between this effective, acidic LNP pKa and the basic intrinsic pKa of aminolipids, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we performed microsecond constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations of five widely used aminolipids (DODAP, DLin-MC3-DMA, DLin-KC2-DMA, ALC-0315, and SM-102) embedded in different LNP-relevant ternary DOPC/DSPC - cholesterol membranes to quantify how aminolipid structure and membrane composition jointly govern aminolipid protonation and the associated pH-dependent membrane remodeling. Across all systems, membrane embedding lowers the apparent aminolipid pKa, yielding physiologically relevant values of 6-7.5 corresponding to shifts by up to 3.5 pKa units or {approx}20 kJ mol-1 with respect to the intrinsic pKa. Strikingly, the magnitude of the pKa shift correlates with pH-driven membrane remodeling upon deprotonation: polyunsaturated aminolipids undergo surface-to-core translocation, branched aminolipids preferentially form laterally segregated surface domains, and DODAP remains interfacially anchored through sustained hydration and hydrogen bonding. Saturated helper lipids (DSPC) systematically enhance segregation and amplify pKa shifts relative to DOPC. Together, these results identify membrane phase behavior as a primary regulator of aminolipid protonation equilibria and establish quantitative design principles for tuning LNP composition toward desired pKa, membrane remodeling, and delivery performance.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy and equitable distribution of viral biologics, including vaccines and virus-like particles, is hindered due to their inherently low shelf life. To increase the longevity of such products, formulations are usually developed with small molecule additives known as excipients. Incorporating excipients is a costly and time-consuming process due to the large excipient design space and unknown mechanisms underlying excipient-virus interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations are, in theory, well-equipped to efficiently investigate these mechanisms. However, the massive size of fully assembled viral capsids--the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome--demands computational resources well beyond the requirements of conventional simulations. There exists a need for a novel method that enables high-throughput investigations of virus-excipient interactions at the molecular level. Here, we introduce CapSACIN--a computational framework for Capsid Surface Abstraction and Computationally-Induced Nanofragmentation. We demonstrate the applicability of this workflow to a model non-enveloped virus, porcine parvovirus (PPV). Through simulations of PPV surface models, we observe that the 2-fold axis of symmetry is significantly weaker at a molecular level than the 3- or 5-fold axes of symmetry. Further, we present results demonstrating excellent agreement with experimentally-determined excipient effects on PPV thermal stability.",

        "abstract": "Chirality in polymeric systems enables a wide range of emergent optical, mechanical, and transport phenomena, yet a unified framework that quantitatively connects molecular-scale geometry to chiral behavior remains lacking. Existing theoretical descriptions typically emphasize either continuum models, such as the helical wormlike chain (HWLC), which neglect intermolecular interactions, or mesophase-level theories, which obscure the role of molecular geometry. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying chirality in helical polymers by extending the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model to explicitly map intrinsic curvature and torsion onto bond angle and dihedral potentials. We establish direct theoretical relationships between helical parameters such as pitch and radius, and connect them to a normalized, dimensionless chirality characteristic, $χ$ that captures local geometric correlations absent from conventional HWLC descriptions. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically quantify the influence of excluded volume interactions and thermal fluctuations on helical geometry and chirality, dispelling the common assumption that monotonic increases in chirality are associated only with decreasing pitch. Finally, we present a coarse-graining procedure that facilitates a direct comparison between experimental helical polymers and the Kremer-Grest helical chain, demonstrating quantitative agreement across a diverse set of polymer classes. This unified geometric and particle-based description provides a predictive roadmap for selecting and engineering chiral Kremer-Grest models and offers a general platform for designing polymeric materials with controlled and tunable chirality.",

        "abstract": "We study the stability of the ordered phase of compressible polar flocks against the nucleation of counter-propagating droplets, using a combination of analytical theory, microscopic and hydrodynamic simulations. For discrete-symmetry flocks, such droplets are known to always grow and propagate, making the ordered phase metastable. We explain how, on the contrary, continuous symmetry can stabilize the ordered phase at small enough noise by destabilizing the leading edge of growing droplets. Flocking models with continuous symmetries thus have a lower critical dimension than their discrete-symmetry counterparts, in contrast to equilibrium physics.",

For origami tessellations, and other corrugated compliant thin shells, the modes are mixed and it is no longer clear what modes, if any, are low in energy in the sense that they are inextensional. Here, it is shown, by direct construction of closed-form solutions, that when the midsurface is a surface of translation, there exists three infinitesimally inextensional deformation modes that correspond to (1) stretching, with an effective Poisson's effect; (2) bending, with an effective synclastic or anti-clastic effect; and to (3) twisting. The provided expressions are valid irrespective of surface regularity and, in particular, properly handle any creases be them straight or curved. The results provide a powerful benchmark for the validation of numerical methods and further insight into the elastic stiffness of thin corrugated compliant shells.",

        "abstract": "Fluid molecular ferroelectrics are a new class of organic materials where ferroelectricity is found in conjunction with 3D fluidity whilst still retaining spontaneous polarization values comparable to their traditional solid state counterparts. One of the major challenges for soft condensed matter physics is predicting whether a fluid molecular material will form ferroelectric phase with nematic or smectic order. Through the synthesis of forty five systematically varied molecules, and by analogy to solid molecular ferroelectrics, is it shown that subtle hydrogen fluorine substitution allows for tuneable syn-parallel pairing motifs resulting in either specific pairings leading too geometrically constrained lamellar order or diversified pairings stabilising nematic ordering. Large-scale, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that smectic ferroelectricity emerges from discrete lateral pairing modes, whereas nematic phases arise from a multiplicity of equivalent polar configurations. Together, these findings establish experimentally validated design principles for fluid molecular ferroelectrics and provide a predictive framework for engineering functional polar fluids.",

        "abstract": "The rare-event sampling problem has long been the central limiting factor in molecular dynamics (MD), especially in biomolecular simulation. Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $Δ$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.",

Computer simulations provide key insights into the formation and behaviour of these emulsions, yet current methods are limited by the spatiotemporal scales accessible for study. The principal issue is that particles are resolved individually. In this work, an alternative strategy is introduced based on phase-field theory, for which we establish the framework. By evolving continuous fields, large-scale dynamics can be simulated in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach is then applied to model the complex formation of a bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel (bijel) via solvent-transfer induced phase separation (STrIPS). By resolving the coupled dynamics of liquid phase separation and nanoparticle adsorption, the model allows for the characterisation of the influence of nanoparticles on the morphology. Higher concentrations of nanoparticles are found to reduce the average domain size of STrIPS bijels, in line with previous experimental evidence. The presented phase-field model thus represents a promising approach for the morphological investigation of complex particle-stabilised emulsions.",

        "abstract": "<p>by Alexandra Mayette, Sean W. Brillant</p>  Vessel-whale collisions are one of the major threats that large whales face worldwide. The probability of lethal injury is an important factor to consider when conducting vessel strike risk assessment, which helps identify areas most at risk. To calculate the probability of lethality, these assessments have commonly used published models, which only account for the vessel speed. A biophysical model has been developed to simulate a vessel strike and estimate a probability of lethality, better accounting for the multiple parameters involved in the interaction, such as whale morphology, vessel dimensions, as well as speed. While the biophysical model is likely to provide more accurate estimates of lethality, some of the parameters required in the model input are not readily accessible, particularly a vessel’s displacement (i.e., its total mass). To facilitate the use of the biophysical model for all users, our objective was to compute vessel-type-specific equations to convert a vessel’s length overall to an estimated displacement. We collected the characteristics from n = 873 vessels, including vessel length overall, maximum deadweight tonnage, and total displacement when available. Vessel data was collected from Automatic Information System static data and other sources, and represented twelve vessel types. We computed a linear regression to test the correlation between the log of vessel length and the log of displacement, by vessel type. The model was significant (p < 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.978) and each vessel type was significantly different from at least one other vessel type. We demonstrated that these equations can then be used to compute the probability of lethality of a vessel strike with the biophysical model and obtain an estimate factored by vessel size. This can be an important tool for risk assessments and can better inform management and conservation measures for large whales.",

Dislocation loops are fundamental topological excitations that control the thermodynamic stability of crystals, yet their role in setting universal aspects of melting has remained unclear. Here we show, within dislocation-mediated melting theory, that the free-energy condition for loop proliferation leads to a universal ratio between the energy of a minimal dislocation loop and the thermal energy at melting. For minimal dislocation loops that begin to proliferate at the onset of melting, this ratio takes the purely geometric value $\\mathcal{E}_* = E_{\\rm loop}/(k_B T_m) \\approx 25.1$, independent of elastic moduli and chemistry-dependent details. This result provides a microscopic explanation for recent empirical findings by Lunkenheimer \\emph{et al.}, who identified a closely related universal energy scale $\\approx 24.6$ from viscosity data.

Through a maximum entropy reweighting approach, we obtain reliable ensembles that more accurately reflect observed chemical shifts and reveal transient states. Our results highlight the importance of comprehensive sampling strategies for capturing diverse conformational states. Furthermore, we show that these weighted ensembles faithfully track conformational rearrangements under various conditions such as temperature, mutational effects, and environment, which are not fully captured by experiments alone. This approach provides a dataset encompassing each IDR’s specific structures along with their weights, offering a foundation for systematically exploring IDR structural landscapes, refining our understanding of their functional roles, and shedding light on processes related to misfolding and aggregation.",

Given the role of spike (S) glycoprotein in mediating SL-CoV cell entry and cross-species transmission, there remains urgent need of structural information on SL-CoV S to guide therapeutic countermeasure development. Among SL-CoVs, bat-derived WIV1 is capable of using as receptor the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from a variety of mammals, thereby representing a prototype model for studying SL-CoV precursors to future pandemics. We present a WIV1 S cryo-EM structure in prefusion state which reveals molecular signatures reminiscent of the tightly-packed locked-1 conformation described for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. To decipher the molecular basis for bat SL-CoV WIV1 host range tropism, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of WIV1 S-ACE2 interaction across reservoir bat, potentially intermediate hosts civet, raccoon dog and pangolin, and accidental human hosts. We found that, in all interactions, upon complex formation with ACE2, the linoleic acid responsible for locking the S receptor binding domain (RBD) dynamically persists in its binding pocket, however repositioning to potentially unlock the system. Complex formation between WIV1 S-RBD and ACE2 from different hosts was characterized in vitro by mass photometry and microscale thermophoresis, revealing that interaction is stronger with ACE2 from bat and human than other hosts, within the latter stronger for the Thr92Ile polymorphism correlated to higher SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility.

Here, we collate cryo-ET data from hundreds of cells and tissues across the biosphere to i) identify emerging methodological trends, ii) pinpoint strategies to reduce imaging time and costs, iii) quantitatively compare methods for cell freezing and sectioning, and iv) census cryo-ET species coverage across all domains of life. Comparing the fraction of cellular material within a single lamella across all domains of life reveals an order of magnitude difference between eukaryotes (1%) compared to bacteria (9%) and archaea (14%). We calculate the fraction of cellular material which can be imaged using distinct sectioning methods on multicellular communities and tissues—identifying serial lift-out as a powerful approach for obtaining more complete cellular depictions. Finally, we show that the biodiversity of current cryo-ET studies is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than in sequence libraries and 4 to 5 lower than the total predicted on Earth.

        "abstract": "Previously we derived the leading term asymptotic solution of temperature distribution in skin heating by an electromagnetic beam at an arbitrary incident angle. The asymptotic analysis is based on that the penetration depth of the beam into skin is much smaller than the size of beam cross-section. It allows arbitrary incident angle. We expand the temperature in powers of the small depth to lateral scale ratio. The incident angle affects all terms in the expansion while the lateral heat conduction appears only in terms of positive even powers. The previously obtained leading term solution captures only the main effect of incident angle. The main effect of lateral heat conduction is contained in the second order term, which is mathematically negligible in the limit of small depth to lateral scale ratio. At a moderate length scale ratio (e.g., 0.1), however, the contribution from lateral conduction is quite significant and needs to be included in a meaningful approximate solution. In this study, we derive closed form analytical expressions for the first order and the second order terms in the asymptotic expansion. The resulting asymptotic solution is capable of predicting the temperature distribution accurately including the effects of both incident angle and lateral heat conduction even at a moderate length scale ratio.",

This intrinsic baseline activity is critical for cellular homeostasis and can be modulated by the receptor conformational ensemble, membrane organization, and interactions with intracellular effectors. In this study, we use live-cell signaling assays, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), and single-particle tracking (SPT) to investigate how membrane organization influences the basal activity of two class A GPCRs: the M1 muscarinic receptor (M1R) and the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). In live-cell signalling assays, M1R showed minimal agonist-independent Ca2+ responses, while A2AR exhibited significant basal cAMP production that was eliminated by an inverse agonist. FCCS showed that, without ligand, only a small portion of M1R co-diffuses with its cognate G11 protein, whereas a much larger fraction of A2AR co-diffuses with the GS protein. SPT revealed that A2AR, but not M1R, is enriched in slowly diffusing, confined states with spatial scales around 150-200 nm and sensitivity to cholesterol- and raft-modulating agents, consistent with localization in lipid-raft nanodomains. Dual-color tracking and diffusion mapping demonstrated that a significant portion of A2AR and GS share confinement domains under basal conditions, while M1R and G11 only show such co-confinement in the active state. These findings support a model where the co-confinement of GPCRs and G proteins within plasma membrane nanodomains, rather than stable pre-coupled RG complexes, determines the level of constitutive GPCR activity",

Thus, the average crowding sensor response may originate from an aqueous biphasic system, reporting an erroneous average response instead of distinct levels of crowdedness. A comparison of excluded volume effects conferred by Ficoll and PEGs of various molecular weight ranges shows the influence of size, concentration, excluded volume, and chemical composition on the CrH2 sensor response. We demonstrate that PEGs enable phase separation and alter sensor response through a mechanism that may be driven by polymer interactions with the flexible hinge region of CrH2. Overall, we determine the biophysical mechanisms underlying PEG-induced condensation of CrH2 and demonstrate a CrD sensor as an alternative that does not undergo phase separation.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a leading contributor to developing familial and idiopathic Parkinsons disease (PD). Most PD-causing LRRK2 mutations increase the kinase activity, leading to increased phosphorylation of Rab GTPases, disrupting vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and autophagy. Under homeostatic conditions, the bulk of WT and PD-mutant LRRK2 is found in the cytosol. However, exogenously expressed LRRK2 can form microtubule-associated filaments that have been shown to affect molecular transport along microtubules in vitro. While the physiological relevance of microtubule binding has not been established yet, inhibitors being designed and tested as therapeutics have been shown to either promote or prevent filament formation of LRRK2. In this study, we examine the localization and resulting molecular organization of hyperactive LRRK2-I2020T, a common PD mutant, in cells treated with type I (MLi-2) or type II (GZD-824) kinase inhibitors. Treatment with a type I kinase inhibitor results in extensive LRRK2-I2020T decoration around microtubules and microtubule bundling. Stabilization of LRRK2-I2020T filaments by type I inhibitor treatment allowed us to build a full-length closed-kinase model of LRRK2-I2020T in its cellular environment. Conversely, treatment with a type II inhibitor resulted in minimal microtubule decoration by LRRK2-I2020T compared to Type I inhibitor treated cells. This study provides a structural framework for understanding how type I and type II kinase inhibitors differentially modulate LRRK2 filament formation, demonstrating that type I inhibitor treatment promotes a distinct filament architecture, whereas such assemblies are not observed with type II inhibitors.",

Yet, the mechanistic basis of this disease, and of the <i>KCNC1</i> disease spectrum, remains unclear. <i>KCNC1</i> encodes Kv3.1, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that is strongly and selectively expressed in neurons capable of generating action potentials at high frequency, including parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in cerebral cortex (PV-INs) that are known to be important for cognitive function and plasticity as well as control of network excitation to prevent seizures. In this study, we generate a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional expression of the A421V pathogenic missense variant (<i>Kcnc1</i>-A421V/+ mice) to explore the specific physiological mechanisms of <i>KCNC1</i> developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Our results indicate that global heterozygous expression of the A421V variant leads to cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and premature lethality. We observe decreased PV-IN cell surface expression of Kv3.1 via immunohistochemistry, decreased voltage-gated potassium current density in PV-INs using outside-out nucleated macropatch recordings in brain slice, and profound impairments in the intrinsic excitability of cerebral cortex PV-INs (but not excitatory neurons) via current-clamp electrophysiology. <i>In vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging revealed altered activity in <i>Kcnc1</i>-A421V/+ PV-INs and excitatory cells, as well as hypersynchronous discharges correlated with brief paroxysmal movements that were subsequently shown to be myoclonic seizures on electroencephalography. We found alterations in PV-IN-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission in young adult but not juvenile <i>Kcnc1</i>-A421V/+ mice relative to wild-type controls.

        "abstract": "Mechanical communications provide physical views to understand cell physiologies at large scale. Cell collective migration occurs often in vivo, of which the role of matrix tension force is largely unknown. Here to mimic in vivo conditions, we applied collective migration of renal epithelial MDCK cells on elastic matrix hydrogel containing bioactive materials of 50% Matrigel and 1&nbsp;mg/mL type I collagen. MDCK cells were engineered with stable expression of ERK FRET (fluorescence energy resonance transfer) biosensor in regarding of ERK sensitivity in cell mechanical response. The results showed that matrix traction force derived from cells-generated contraction promoted epithelial sheet migration with higher ERK activity at the move front. Hydrogel crosslinking by glutaraldehyde blocked matrix traction transmission and then reduced ERK and epithelial collective migration. Integrin inhibition dramatically reduced collective migration but not local cell moving velocities, indicating integrin acting with mechanotransduction role at cells-hydrogel interface in orienting migration direction. Further experiments demonstrated that matrix traction force relied on activations of cellular mechanosensitive calcium channels, and ERK signal in promoting collective migration. In conclusion, matrix tension force derived from cell contractions facilitates epithelial collective migration through activating cellular mechanosensitive signals, in which integrin acts as mechanical transducer. This work highlights the role of matrix traction force in wound healing and tissue engineering.",

Here, we introduce a label-free, real-time, mass-resolved single-molecule immunoassay based on interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) that directly observes individual protein-protein binding events in complex biological samples. By detecting light scattered from single proteins as they bind to an antibody-functionalized surface, we resolve discrete antibody-antigen interactions with single-molecule sensitivity and molecular-weight discrimination. Using IgM as a model system, we demonstrate real-time detection of individual binding events, with measured association rates that scale linearly with concentration over three orders of magnitude. Direct counts of IgM binding events in human serum yield quantitative concentrations that agree with bulk measurements obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This bioaffinity iSCAT platform unifies molecular specificity, label-free detection, real-time kinetics, and mass-resolved single-molecule sensitivity, enabling direct access to protein-protein recognition processes and establishing a general framework for quantitative, single-molecule immunoassays.",

        "abstract": "The unfolding or melting temperature (TM) is a central quantity to characterize the stability of proteins and other biopolymers. The accurate prediction of protein melting temperatures by molecular mechanics force field simulations is highly desirable for many biophysical and biotechnological applications. Since the time scales for protein (un-)folding are hardly accessible in conventional MD (cMD) simulations, enhanced sampling techniques such as Temperature Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (TREMD) are typically employed. However, TREMD simulations are computationally very demanding especially if large temperature ranges need to be covered. Additionally, if the TM is initially unknown, setting up TREMD simulations is often challenging. To find the optimal initial conditions for such simulations, we describe their performance based on a theoretical model, which we validate on a minimalistic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation setup. In an effort to reduce the computational demand, we have investigated the possibility to use small sets of TREMD temperature ladders placed iteratively in the vicinity of a TM estimate. Different TREMD setups were extensively tested on the fast-folding protein Chignolin. We found that appropriate starting conformations lead to significantly faster convergence. Furthermore, we found that, in practice, combining multiple small temperature ladders can be advantageous in comparison to one single temperature ladder. Based on our findings, we formulate practical recommendations on how to set up TREMD for protein melting with optimal efficiency.",

Combined structural, biochemical, and target molecular dynamics analyses show that HCHO is generated in a catalytic core and guided through a tunnel to a remote tetrahydrofolate (THF)-binding site, where it forms methylene-THF.

        "abstract": "Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are widely prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics, with newer generations capable of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB). Previous studies have reported the actin-destabilizing effects of FQs, suggesting their potential for drug repurposing. Actin-associated neuropathies are characterised by the formation of persistent, F-actin aggregates in neurons, which impair critical cellular functions. Therefore, identifying small molecules that can disrupt these actin filaments and aggregates can provide a promising therapeutic strategy. This research aims to map the direct interaction between FQs and F-actin to identify the structural basis for actin disruption. We demonstrated that FQs irreversibly disrupt F-actin filaments in a concentration-dependent manner using scattering-based assay. Electron microscopy and gel filtration confirmed generation-dependent disruption activity. In particular, Gen3 and Gen4 FQs reduced actin aggregates in more than 60% yeast cells. FQ treatment altered the thermal stability of F-actin at both 1:30 and 1:50 molar ratios with minor secondary structural changes. To explore the molecular insights of FQs interaction with F-actin, saturation transfer difference-NMR combined with complementary molecular dynamics simulations revealed the importance of the fluorinated quinolone core, which is common to all FQs. These studies highlight the involvement of an amino group at R5, and bulky piperazine, azabicyclo rings at the R7 position in driving F-actin disruption. We would like to propose that rational modifications at R5 and R7 positions can enhance both actin-disrupting potency and BBB permeability, thereby providing a basis for developing FQs derived therapeutics against actin-related neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "abstract": "Hyponatremia is a prevalent disorder marked by excess water retention and substantial morbidity, motivating interest in the CLC-Ka chloride channel as a therapeutic target. Selectively inhibiting CLC-Ka without affecting the closely related CLC-Kb is essential for preventing serious side effects. However, developing isoform-selective inhibitors has been challenging because most small molecules do not distinguish between CLC-Ka and CLC-Kb, and the basis for selectivity in the few known exceptions remains unclear. The small molecule BIM1 preferentially inhibits CLC-Ka over CLC-Kb, providing an opportunity to dissect isoform-specific pharmacology. To investigate this mechanism, we determined cryo-EM structures of BIM1 and BIM15, a related nonselective analog, bound to a CLC-K variant engineered to match the human CLC-Ka binding pocket. Structural and computational analyses reveal that inhibition and isoform selectivity are anchored by interactions with a conserved lysine, with surrounding binding-site residues subtly tuning the local electrostatic environment to promote or disfavor these contacts. These analyses further identify a dynamic extracellular loop that intermittently occludes the access pathway, indicating its role as a gate for ions and inhibitors. BIM15 engages this gating loop more extensively than BIM1, suggesting that differential loop engagement contributes to inhibitor selectivity. To probe how gating reshapes this region, we solved the structure in the presence of Ca{superscript 2}, which favors channel opening, and found the gating loop ordered and withdrawn from the pathway. Together, these findings elucidate how CLC-K channels gate and how subtle binding-site differences and loop dynamics shape isoform-specific drug binding, providing a foundation for designing next-generation CLC-Ka inhibitors.  Significance StatementHyponatremia is a major clinical problem with limited therapeutic options. The kidney chloride channel CLC-Ka is an attractive drug target, but its high sequence similarity to CLC-Kb complicates the development of isoform-selective inhibitors, which is required to create a safe drug. Combining cryo-EM structures with molecular dynamics simulations, we define how inhibitors bind at the pore entryway of CLC-Ka and uncover the molecular basis for inhibitor isoform selectivity. We further show that a dynamic extracellular loop can cap the pore and act as a gating element that shapes inhibitor access and engagement. These findings establish a mechanistic foundation for developing improved treatments for hyponatremia.",

        "abstract": "Model asymmetric lipid bilayers provide a powerful platform for probing how lateral phase behavior in one leaflet is coupled to that of the opposing leaflet. Here, we use calcium-induced hemifusion to generate asymmetric giant unilamellar vesicles (aGUVs) and investigate how lipid composition modulates interleaflet coupling of liquid-liquid phase separation. Symmetric GUVs composed of cholesterol, the high-melting lipid DPPC, and a low-melting phosphatidylcholine (either 14:1-PC or 16:1-PC) were prepared at compositions exhibiting coexisting liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) phases. Hemifusion with a uniformly mixed supported lipid bilayer composed of the low-melting lipid and cholesterol selectively altered the outer leaflet composition, producing aGUVs with controlled but variable asymmetry. Quantification of outer leaflet exchange using both probe-exit and probe-entry fluorescence measurements revealed substantial vesicle-to-vesicle variability within a given preparation, resulting in overlapping populations of phase-separated and uniformly mixed aGUVs. To account for this variability, we developed a population-based, coupled-distributions framework that enables robust determination of the asymmetric miscibility boundary, defined as the outer leaflet composition at which macroscopic phase separation is suppressed. Independent analyses of probe-exit and probe-entry data yielded consistent boundary locations. Comparing the two lipid systems, we find that aGUVs containing 14:1-PC require significantly greater outer leaflet exchange to abolish phase separation than those containing 16:1-PC. Only in the 14:1-PC system do we observe vesicles exhibiting coexistence of distinct anti-registered phases, a theoretically predicted but rarely observed regime consistent with large hydrophobic mismatch. By expressing both symmetric and asymmetric miscibility boundaries in a common fractional-coordinate framework, we introduce a phenomenological parameter, {Delta}*, that quantifies the direction and strength of interleaflet coupling of phase behavior. Together, these results demonstrate that modest changes in lipid chain length can markedly alter asymmetric miscibility boundaries and provide a quantitative link between experimental observations, leaflet dominance concepts, and coupled-leaflet theories of membrane organization.  Statement of SignificanceMembrane asymmetry is a defining feature of eukaryotic cells whose influence on lateral membrane organization remains unclear. Using asymmetric giant vesicles, we find that coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains transition to a uniform appearance as saturated lipid in the outer leaflet is replaced with unsaturated lipid. The extent of exchange required to disrupt phase separation increased with acyl-chain length mismatch, revealing a compositional dependence of interleaflet coupling. In mixtures with greater hydrophobic mismatch, we also observe coexisting anti-registered phases predicted by theory but rarely observed experimentally, providing new constraints for models of coupled-leaflet behavior. By accounting for vesicle-to-vesicle compositional variability, these results provide a framework for measuring asymmetric miscibility boundaries and for connecting asymmetric membrane organization to lipid raft phenomena.",

Actin filaments are highly similar across different muscle types and species both invertebrate and vertebrate3. Myosin filaments of vertebrate striated muscle are quite homogeneous in structure having identical lengths, governed by the giant protein titin4,5, and rotational symmetries while varying mostly in the isoforms of its proteins. Conversely, myosin filaments from invertebrate striated muscle are highly heterogeneous in multiple ways even within a single organism. Myosin filaments from vertebrate cardiac muscle have been shown to be highly similar in structure between mice and humans6-8. Conversely, thick filaments from the highly specialized insect indirect flight muscle have been shown to be highly variable in structure9-14. Here we used the drug mavacamten to stabilize a myosin head conformation known as the interacting heads motif in a fast skeletal muscle of rabbits, a highly studied model system. We show that the structure of relaxed rabbit skeletal muscle thick filaments is highly similar to those of relaxed human and mouse cardiac muscle, differing primarily in the positioning of some domains of myosin binding protein C vis-a-vis titin. In the context of the very different structures from indirect flight muscle, the result highlights different solutions to the same problems, control of muscle force and the requirements of endothermy, the internal generation of heat. In mammals, thick filaments are poised for varying levels of myosin activation15, while indirect flight muscle is poised for narrowly defined, high frequency contraction. In mammals, endothermy is a continuous problem; in insects, endothermy is primarily necessary for flight16.",

However, it is still unclear how cohesion is established and how it reshapes the relative organization of replicated chromosomes to achieve its functions. In this study, we address these questions in the biological context of budding yeast, by disentangling the interplay between two major structural functions of cohesin: organizing individual chromatids through loop extrusion and sister chromatids through cohesion. Combining polymer modeling and detailed analysis of recent experimental data of replicated chromosomes in G2/M, we show that extruding and cohesive cohesins are sparsely distributed leading to mildly compacted and loosely aligned sister chromatids. Genome-wide analysis of inter-chromatid contact maps in WT and mutant conditions suggests that cohesion is asymmetric, favoring the tethering between non-homologous cohesin-enriched regions. Our work highlights the dual role played by cohesin in structuring the replicated genome and questions how homologous recombination may function in the context of asymmetric, partial alignment of sister chromatids.",

        "abstract": "Motivation: Hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HX-MS) is a rapidly expanding technique used to investigate protein conformational ensembles. The growing popularity and utility of HX-MS has driven the development of diverse instrumentation and software, resulting in inconsistent, non-standardized data analysis and representation. Most HX-MS data formats also employ only mean deuteration representations of the data rather than full isotopic mass spectra, which reduces the information content of the data and limits downstream quantitative analysis. Results: Inspired by reliable protein structure and genomics data formats, we present HXMS, a unified, lightweight, scalable, and human-readable file format for HX-MS data. The HXMS format preserves the isotopic mass envelopes for all peptides, captures the full experimental time-course including fully deuterated control samples, and contains all other key information. It supports multimodal distributions, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and experimental replicates. To promote compatibility with existing HX-MS workflows, we also developed PFLink, a Python package that converts exported data files from commonly used HX-MS software to the HXMS format. PFLink and the HXMS format will enable more quantitative, higher-resolution data processing, improved data sharing and storage among HX-MS practitioners, future machine learning applications, and further developments in HX-MS analysis. Availability and implementation: PFLink is publicly available to install locally on HuggingFace, alongside documentation, or use online at HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/spaces/glasgow-lab/PFlink). The supplemental information includes sample input files, sample HXMS files, and a generic unfilled PFlink custom CSV file that users may populate with key experimental conditions and results, which can then be read and converted into the HXMS format.",

        "abstract": "Counterconditioning (CC) aims to enhance extinction of threat memories by establishing new associations of opposite valence. While its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain largely unexplored, previous studies suggest qualitatively different mechanisms from regular extinction. In this functional MRI study, participants underwent categorical threat conditioning (CS+/CS-: images of animals/tools), followed by either CC (CS + images reinforced with monetary rewards, n=24) or regular extinction (n=24). The following day, we assessed spontaneous recovery of threat responses and episodic memory for CS + and CS- category exemplars. While the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was activated during regular extinction, participants undergoing CC showed persistent CS+-specific deactivation of the vmPFC and hippocampus, and CS+-specific activation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The following day, physiological threat responses returned in the regular extinction group, but not in the CC group. Counterconditioning furthermore strengthened episodic memory for CS + exemplars presented during CC, and retroactively also for CS + exemplars presented during the threat conditioning phase. Our findings confirm that CC leads to more persistent extinction of threat memories, as well as altered consolidation of the threat conditioning episode. Crucially, we show a qualitatively different activation pattern during CC versus regular extinction, with a shift away from the vmPFC and towards the NAcc.",

These TMD mutations are generally not targetable as they are buried in membrane. Here, we determined the mechanism of a gain-of-function (GOF) TMD mutation of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and addressed the possibility of directly targeting the TMD mutation by using rationally designed transmembrane helices to restore order to uncontrolled signaling. We find that the GOF mutation of IL-7R severely shifts the TMD homodimerization interface, causing the receptor to homodimerize in a geometry that activates downstream signaling independent of ligand. Designed transmembrane helices that interfere with the new interface, delivered with mRNA technology, selectively block ligand-independent but not ligand-dependent signaling. Our study provides a conceptual framework for understanding and repairing disease-causing TMD mutations of single-pass cytokine receptors.",

        "abstract": "Cells excel at interpreting noisy chemical gradients to guide fertilization, development, and immune responses, but the mechanisms underlying this remarkable ability remain poorly understood. Previous work showed that some G protein signaling pathways can overcome challenges from uneven receptor distribution by using a ratiometric signaling strategy. In this mechanism, G proteins receive information from both bound and unbound receptors, unlike classical signaling where only bound receptors contribute. Here, we show that ratiometric signaling also provides an unexpected ability to suppress noise from low receptor numbers. The benefit stems from each G protein remembering the last receptor state it encountered, so that at any instant, ratiometric G protein collectives reflect time-averaged receptor activity. Unlike classical signaling, this averaging remains unbiased and accurate across the varying ligand concentrations present in a spatial gradient. Using theory and simulations, we demonstrate that this averaging mechanism allows cells to surpass theoretical limits for gradient detection from instantaneous receptor information alone. Our findings reveal how ratiometric biochemical architectures enable robust temporal integration across spatially varying signals, providing cells with enhanced directional accuracy under noisy conditions.",

        "abstract": "Nucleosomes regulate DNA accessibility through partial DNA unwrapping driven by thermal fluctuations or forces exerted by molecular motors. Despite substantial chemical and DNA sequence diversity in vivo, much of our mechanistic understanding of nucleosome unwrapping is derived from canonical constructs. Here, we use a near-atomistic coarse-grained model to quantify the energetics and mechanisms of force-induced nucleosome unwrapping across 40 nucleosomes spanning genomic and synthetic DNA sequences, histone variants, and post-translational modifications. We find that the force barriers to nucleosome unwrapping are shaped by histone composition and DNA flexibility, and arise from the formation of topologically protected, partially unwrapped intermediates. Strong nucleosome-positioning and genomic sequences consistently fall within a  Goldilocks zone of intermediate DNA flexibility, which enables the formation of thermodynamically stable yet mechanically plastic nucleosomes that undergo controlled deformation under applied force. Limited mechanical variation within this zone results in modest DNA sequence-dependent effects on nucleosome deformability. In contrast, histone variants and post-translational modifications modulate nucleosome stability and plasticity in a strong non-additive manner, with predominant contributions from H3 and H2A core arginines and H3 and H2B tail lysines. Together, our results provide a physical framework linking DNA sequence, histone composition, and nucleosome geometry to nucleosome stability, plasticity and DNA accessibility.",

        "abstract": "BK channels are a class of K+ channels that possess an unusually high conductance and are synergistically gated by intracellular Ca2+ and voltage. Despite the significant array of experimental and computational data, many aspects of their function and dynamics remain unclear - such as how ion permeation is halted in the closed state of the channel. Available CryoEM structures obtained in deactivating conditions capture the channel with a wide, unobstructed pore, in contrast to e.g. a helix bundle crossing observed in some K+ channels. Several hypotheses of BK closure were proposed, including selectivity filter and hydrophobic gating. In this work, we expand on the model of hydrophobic gating and focus on the role of lipids. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with applied voltage, we directly investigate the ability of the full length BK channel in various CryoEM states to permeate ions, and propose lipid entrance into the pore - either with lipid tails or entire lipid molecules - through the membrane-facing fenestrations to be a critical determinant of BK conductivity. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism of BK activation by negatively charged lipids via a combination of atomistic & coarse-grained simulations, and suggest that they act by a multi-modal mechanism, which encompasses lipid entry reduction, increase of the K+ occupancy of the pore, and stabilization of the channels open-state structure - in broad agreement with experimental data.",

Pinpointing the underlying mechanism triggering the onset of thrombus formation may aid development of device design, as well as management of anti-coagulation, benefiting patient outcome. Here we present a combined methodology enabling a multiscale understanding of thrombus development. Two thrombi collected from different ECMO circuits were analyzed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), ultra small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). USAXS quantified the density and bulk alignment of fibrin, building the thrombus scaffold structure. SEM provided information on cellular morphology and surface fibrin structure, and CFD identified regions in the ECMO circuit with high thrombotic potential. Together, this combined approach was able to link local flow conditions and the structural growth of thrombi in ECMO circuits.",

        "abstract": "Many biological proteins can assemble into dynamic, non-stoichiometric structures known as biomolecular condensates. Although typically observed at micrometer scales in vitro, recent evidence shows that these condensates often appear as nanoscale assemblies both in vitro and in cells. Moreover, biochemical reactions can be more efficiently promoted in nanoscale condensates than in micron-sized droplets, due to mass-transfer limitations and interfacial effects. Therefore, in analogy with colloids, the function of condensate materials can be engineered by tuning their size distribution. However, controlling the size of condensates remains challenging, as the molecular mechanisms that prevent small condensates from coarsening into larger ones are still poorly understood. Here, we developed and applied a computational pipeline that combines high-throughput molecular simulations, machine learning, and mixed-integer linear programming to design phase-separating peptides that form metastable nanocondensates across a broad range of experimental conditions. In addition to experimentally validating these peptides, we elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and derive initial design rules. In particular, we show that scaffold net charge combined with sequence blockiness can lead to high phase separation propensity while simultaneously yielding low interfacial tension, thereby slowing ripening. Moreover, these combined properties induce an electrostatics-driven alignment of molecules at the interface, which generates an additional size-dependent coalescence barrier. We further show that these features are shared by biological proteins, providing a possible mechanistic basis for the widespread occurrence of nanocondensates in biological systems. Altogether, our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms behind nanocondensate formation, and provide a platform to design nanocondensates for several potential applications in bioengineering and biotechnology.",

Despite remarkable progress in quantitative biology, a quantitative understanding of the cell adaptation dynamics in terms of the underlying cellular network remains elusive. Here, we present the next-generation chemical dynamics model and theory for cellular networks, providing an effective, quantitative description of the adaptive gene expression dynamics in living cells responding to external stimuli. Unlike conventional kinetics, chemical dynamics of cellular network modules are characterized by their reaction-time distributions, rather than by rate coefficients. For a general model of cell signal transduction and adaptive gene expression, we derive exact analytical expressions for the time-dependent mean and variance of protein numbers produced in response to external stimuli, validated by accurate stochastic simulations. These results provide a unified, quantitative explanation of the stochastic responses of diverse E. coli genes to antibiotic stress and transcriptional induction. Our analysis reveals existence of a general quadratic relationship between the mean and variance of activation times across diverse genes. The gene activation process influences transient dynamics of downstream protein levels, but not their steady-state levels. In contrast, post-translational maturation process affects both transient dynamics and steady-state variability of mature protein levels. This finding indicates that the gene expression variability measured by fluorescent reporter proteins depends on the maturation time of the reporters.

        "abstract": "Stochastic variation in protein expression generates phenotypic heterogeneity in a cell population and has an important role in antibiotic persistence, mutation penetrance, tumor growth, and therapy resistance. Studies investigating molecular origins of noise have predominantly focused on the transcription process. However, the noise generated in the transcription process is further modulated by translation. This influences the expression noise at the protein level which eventually determines the extent of phenotypic heterogeneity in a cell population. Studies across different organisms have revealed a positive association between translational efficiency and protein noise. However, the molecular basis of this association has remained unknown. In this work, through stochastic modeling of translation in single mRNA molecules and empirical measurements of protein noise, we show that ribosome demand associated with high translational efficiency in a gene drives the correlation between translational efficiency and protein noise. We also show that this correlation is present only in genes with bursty transcription. Thus, our work reveals the molecular basis of how coding sequence of genes, along with their promoters, can regulate noise. These findings have important implications for investigating protein noise and phenotypic heterogeneity across biological systems.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundComputational modeling is a tool being deployed for orthopaedic solutions but its use in the hand and wrist remains limited. This work used a model to simulate a clinically relevant provocative scaphoid shift maneuver (SSM) with different levels of scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) injuries to observe the effect on different metrics.  MethodsA personalized model simulated the full SSM motion cycle from ulnar deviation with extension to radial deviation with flexion informed by the participants motion obtained from dynamic computed tomography. Models repeated the SSM under different levels of SLIL injury and reported changes in joint kinematics, contact mechanics, and ligament forces.  ResultsThe fully injured model increased scaphoid dorsal translation, flexion, and radial deviation compared to the intact condition and caused a subluxation of the scaphoid. Radioscaphoid contact areas were approximately 200% greater in the fully injured model compared with all others and the fully injured model was the only condition where contact force decreased across the motion cycle. Ligament forces in the intact condition were on average 33.0 N and 54.2 N for the volar and dorsal SLIL, respectively. Lastly, the long radiolunate, an extrinsic stabilizer, had forces that increased following SLIL injury.  ConclusionsComputational models can successfully recreate clinically observed behaviors of an SSM, including scaphoid subluxation, while providing new insights via quantification of contact mechanics and ligament forces. Contact mechanics metrics may be important for understanding the long-term progression of untreated SLIL injuries to osteoarthritis. Additionally, ligament force metrics may explain the progression of SLIL injuries from volar SLIL to dorsal SLIL and highlight the importance of repairing extrinsic stabilizers of the joint, due to increased force sharing following SLIL injury. This work provides a pathway to future studies investigating the effects of SLIL injury and repair, both acutely and chronically.",

        "abstract": "Active networks composed of biopolymers and motor proteins provide versatile biomimetic systems that have advanced active matter physics and deepened our understanding of cytoskeletal dynamics and self-organization under diverse stimuli. In these systems, activity arises in aqueous solutions where motor proteins cross-link biopolymers and generate active stress driving the emergent network behavior. Here, we establish the active network in the form of a sessile, multi-component droplet on a substrate and investigate how evaporation influences its dynamics. We focus on how mass loss and compositional changes in the droplet reshape the behavior of the active suspension. We show that capillary and Marangoni flows drive the self-organization of microtubules into a distinctive radial arrangement within the droplet. The cross-linking ability of motor proteins gives rise to a striking non-monotonic wetting behavior, where the extensile stresses generated by the motor proteins strongly affect the characteristic timescale of the contact-line retracting and subsequent expansion. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we demonstrate the crucial role of crosslinking in evaporating microtubule networks, and explain how active stresses together with evaporation-induced flows govern the dynamics of reconstituted microtubule systems and their wetting behavior. Evaporating droplets have recently attracted significant attention in the scientific community, and the findings of the setup presented in this study can have broad implications, ranging from self-organization and mechanical pattern formation in biological systems to questions about the origin of life.",

        "abstract": "Dense granular flows exhibit nonlocal effects due to stress transmission in microplastic events, especially in quasi-static or slowly sheared regions. Hence, traditional local rheological models fail to capture spatial cooperativity effects that are prominent in many granular systems. The nonlocal granular fluidity (NGF) model addresses this limitation by introducing a diffusive-like partial differential equation for a fluidity field, governed by a key material-dependent parameter: the nonlocal amplitude A. However, determining A from experiments or simulations is known to be difficult and typically requires extensive calibration across multiple geometries. In this work, we present a data-driven platform based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embedded with the NGF model, capable of solving granular flows in a forward or inverse manner. We show that once trained on transient flow fields, these non-local PINNs can readily infer the material parameters, as well as the pressure and stress fields. These data-driven frameworks allow for accurate recovery of small variations in the nonlocal amplitude, A, which lead to sharp bifurcation-like transitions in the flow field. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven parameter inference in complex nonlocal models and opens up new possibilities for characterizing granular materials from sparse experimental observations.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16074v1",
        "abstract": "Complex systems out of equilibrium often experience intermittent oscillations between quiescent and highly dynamic states. The type of intermittency depends on how energy is pumped into the system, and how it is dissipated. While intermittency is usually driven by stochastic noise or external forcing, energy can also be sourced from field-mediated interactions between particles, which are often nonreciprocal and effectively violate Newton's 3rd law. Here we demonstrate how nonreciprocal interactions produce intermittency in clusters of charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath. Through three-dimensional particle tracking, we observe that vertical oscillations, induced by fluctuations of the plasma environment, can be parametrically coupled to the horizontal modes. Experiments and simulations show that nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify this parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both the horizontal and vertical modes. This mechanism triggers abrupt melting transitions from an ordered cluster to an ergodic gas-like state, and leads to intermittent switching between states over long time scales. Overall, our work identifies nonreciprocal interactions as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16002v1",
        "abstract": "It is with great regret that Prof. Wolfgang Helfrich passed away on 28 September 2025 in Berlin. As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15795v1",
        "abstract": "Understanding how polymer architecture governs transport through nanopores is essential for nanocomposite fabrication, membrane design, and polymer upcycling. However, the effect of the nanoscale structure of copolymers on chain transport through nanoporous media remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that simply inverting the surface orientation of lamellar poly(styrene-block-2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) diblock copolymers, composed of two monomers with strongly contrasting affinities for SiO2, at the entrance of nanoporous silica significantly alters the kinetics of capillary rise infiltration. Using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry, we find that infiltration of symmetric PS-b-P2VP into silica nanoparticle (SiO2 NP) packings is significantly faster when the P2VP domain is the top layer of the film and first contacts the nanoparticles, compared to when the PS domain is the top layer. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this difference originates from block-specific adsorption pathways that reorganize the nanophase structure around nanoparticles: P2VP-first infiltration forms thin adsorbed layers that drive PS into the pore interiors, generating continuous interfacial pathways that enable rapid, interface-mediated transport. In contrast, PS-first infiltration produces thicker P2VP layers that isolate PS domains and disrupt pathway connectivity, forcing chains to rely on a slower, connectivity-limited transport mechanism through P2VP-rich interstitial regions. Above the order-disorder transition, or upon silanizing nanoparticles to neutralize surface affinity, the rate difference disappears. These findings demonstrate how the interplay between nanoscale domain configuration and polymer-surface affinity governs infiltration dynamics, providing mechanistic insight into tuning transport in nanostructured block copolymers.",

In stark contrast to the well-studied case of Brownian particles -- for which the mean fFPT vanishes logarithmically with $N$ -- we uncover that the mean fFPT is bounded from below by the minimal ballistic travel time, with an exponentially fast convergence to this bound as $N \\to \\infty$. This behavior reveals a dramatic efficiency advantage of physically realistic, finite-speed searchers over Brownian ones and illustrates how diffusive macroscopic models may be conceptually misleading in predicting the short-time behavior of a physical system. We extend our analysis to anomalous diffusion generated by Riemann-Liouville-type dichotomous noises and find that target detection is more efficient in the superdiffusive regime, followed by normal and then subdiffusive regimes, in agreement with physical intuition and contrary to earlier predictions.",

        "abstract": "We develop a perturbation theory to study the shape and the orientation of an initially spherical capsule of radius R with a viscosity contrast, a surface tension σ and a bending rigidity $κ$ in linear flows. The elastic mechanical response of membrane to deformations is described by three elastic constitutive law which are either Hookean, Neohookean or Skalak type leading to the introduction of a surface shear elastic modulus $G_s$ and the Poisson ratio (or analog quantities). At the leading order, the deformation, i.e. the so-called Taylor parameter is proportional to the elastic capillary number Ca which evaluates the ratio between the external viscous stress and the elastic membrane response. In this linear regime, the results do not depend on the elastic constitutive law as expected. Without surface tension and bending rigidity, we recover the results of Barthes-Biesel & Rallison (1981) and notably the fact that the Taylor parameter does not depend on the viscosity contrast $λ$ contrary to the case of a viscous droplet. In our more general model, the deformation does no longer depend on $λ$ at the upper order. Now, the Taylor parameter also depends on two other dimensionless numbers: the surface elastocapillary ratio $σ/G_s$ and the dimensionless bending rigidity $B= κ/G_sR^2$. At the further order, the angle of inclination of the capsule with the direction of the shear flow, the analog of the Chaffey and Brenner equation for droplets is determined in each case. The results are in excellent agreement with the numerical ones performed with a code based on the boundary integral method providing an useful method to valid numerical developments.",

        "abstract": "Like a crêpe resting on a plate, a thin elastic sheet can fold smoothly under its own weight, forming reversible shapes without creases or imposed hinges. Such soft folds arise from a balance between elastic bending and gravity, yet their stability, packing limits, and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we show that these behaviors are governed by a single physical length scale, the elasto-gravity length $\\ell_{eg}$. Using experiments and heavy-elastica theory, we demonstrate that $\\ell_{eg}$ sets the characteristic fold geometry, determines when a fold becomes unstable and unfolds, and limits how many reversible folds can be stacked in rectangular and circular sheets. In particular, when lengths are rescaled by $\\ell_{eg}$, fold shapes and stability thresholds collapse across materials and thicknesses. We further show that unfolding follows a universal speed scaling $v \\sim \\sqrt{g\\,\\ell_{eg}}$, revealing a gravity-controlled time scale for the release of stored bending energy. Together, these results establish a unified physical framework for reversible folding, compact storage, and gravity-assisted deployment of thin elastic sheets.",

Continuum methods capture large-scale wave propagation but cannot resolve microscale interactions, while particle-based approaches offer molecular resolution but struggle with efficiency and stability at larger scales. We introduce a particle-based virtual ultrasound machine that uses a novel smoothed dissipative particle dynamics variant with an implicit pressure solver and a negative-pressure stabilization scheme, required to mimic acoustic propagation across MHz-GHz frequencies. We demonstrate its capabilities by modeling the acoustophoresis of encapsulated microbubbles, a key mechanism in ultrasound-mediated drug delivery.

        "abstract": "Direct numerical simulations of electrospinning and electrospraying are computationally demanding due to large-scale separation between the needle and the tip-to-collector distance. The cone-jet mode that occurs in the vicinity of the needle arises from a delicate balance between surface tension, viscous stresses, inertia, and electric stresses. This mode has a central role in determining the subsequent instabilities of the jet and the eventual outcomes on the collector. Truncated-domain simulations offer a viable alternative but depend critically on the accuracy of far-field electrostatic boundary conditions. Existing truncated-domain approaches based on analytical expressions for the electric potential systematically underestimate the electric field near the needle tip and require empirical tuning informed by prior experiments or full-domain simulations, thereby limiting their predictive capability. Here, we present a general truncated-domain framework for electrohydrodynamic (EHD) simulations of the cone-jet mode that avoids these limitations. Our approach exploits inexpensive full-domain electrostatic simulations to obtain the exact electric field and potential distributions near the needle, which are then imposed as boundary conditions in an EHD simulation carried out on a truncated domain. Comparisons with full-domain EHD simulations and experimental data demonstrate that the proposed approach accurately reproduces cone-jet shapes as well as key physical quantities, including electric currents, charge distributions, velocity fields, and Maxwell stresses, while converging at substantially smaller domain sizes. The formulation eliminates tunable parameters, does not require prior knowledge of the cone-jet configuration, and significantly reduces computational cost, providing a reliable and predictive framework for studying electrohydrodynamic cone-jet flows.",

To understand the connection between asymmetry and activation, we used single-particle cryo-EM to solve sixteen structures of nanodisc-reconstituted CorA.

These results suggest that γ1 not only increases the energetic coupling between the voltage sensors and the pore but also primarily enhances the channel-opening reaction.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15348v1",
        "abstract": "Transport in soft jammed materials is often described as fluid motion through a fixed structure, leading naturally to capillary based descriptions. This picture appears particularly appropriate in strongly jammed systems, where structural rearrangements are suppressed and little visible motion is observed. Here we investigate solvent transport in foam and show that this intuition fails to capture key aspects of the transport process. By directly observing both liquid penetration and bubble motion under controlled boundary conditions, we demonstrate that solvent transport is strongly influenced by the mechanical response of the foam structure, even though the intrinsic imbibition relative to the foam matrix remains purely capillary-driven. In closed systems, the jammed structure resists penetration and leads to a pronounced slowdown that cannot be accounted for by purely capillary descriptions. In contrast, in open systems, collective bubble motion accompanies solvent invasion, resulting in an apparent acceleration of transport. These results indicate that the lack of structural motion does not guarantee a purely capillary description of transport. Our findings reveal a boundary controlled coupling between flow and structure, and highlight the need to reconsider transport processes in soft jammed systems, including foams, dense colloids, and biological tissues.",

Here, we designed an object-matching task where human participants unknowingly manipulated object variants arranged in a ring-like structure around a central prototype. Functional MRI revealed a threefold spatial periodicity in the hippocampal activity that tracked navigation directions from object variants to the central prototype. This hippocampal periodicity was phase-locked with the well-documented sixfold periodicity of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting hierarchical interaction between these regions. Consistent with this neural pattern, a corresponding threefold periodicity was observed in behavioral performance, which was synchronized with hippocampal activity. Finally, an EC-HPC PhaseSync model reproduced this phenomenon, in which the sixfold activity periodicity of entorhinal grid cells across directions projects vectorial representations to the hippocampus, and the collection of these vectors exhibits threefold periodicity to represent conceptual directions. Together, these findings reveal a periodic mechanism through which entorhinal grid codes structure hippocampal vector representations.",

        "abstract": "<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a major human opportunistic pathogen associated with a high incidence of multi-drug resistance. The antibody-based blockade of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> virulence factors represents a promising alternative strategy to mitigate its infectivity. In this study, we employed single B cell sorting from cystic fibrosis patients to isolate human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting proteins from the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) and characterized a panel of mAbs directed at PscF and PcrV. Among those, two mAbs, P5B3 and P3D6, that bind to the injectisome tip protein PcrV, exhibited T3SS blocking activity. We solved the crystal structure of the P3D6 Fab-PcrV complex, which revealed that the Ab binds to the C-terminal region of PcrV. In addition, we compared the T3SS-blocking activity of three PcrV-targeting mAbs, including two from previous independent studies, using two distinct assays to evaluate pore formation and toxin injection. We conducted a mechanistic and structural analysis of their modes of action through modeling based on the known structure of a functional homolog, SipD from <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. The analysis suggests that anti-PcrV mAbs may act through different mechanisms, ranging from preventing PcrV oligomerization to disrupting PcrV’s scaffolding function, thereby inhibiting the assembly and function of the translocon pore. Our findings provide additional evidence that T3SS-targeting Abs, some capable of inhibiting virulence, are elicited in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>-infected patients. The results offer deeper insights into PcrV recognition by mAbs and their associated mechanisms of action, helping to identify which Abs are more likely to be therapeutically useful based on their mode of action and potency. This paves the way for the development of effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics in the fight against this resilient pathogen.",

While most studies have focused on ascent, descending behaviors also provide insight into the functional significance of arboreal adaptations. To test how descending vertical supports of varying diameters affect locomotor abilities, we quantified postural and kinematic features during descents and ascents on vertical supports in 21 eutherian and metatherian mammals and examined their relation to morphology. Primates showed greater variability in descent behaviors, using tail-first and side postures more often than other mammals, which predominantly descended head-first. Overall, animals adopted several kinematic adjustments to enhance stability during descent compared to ascent, including slower speeds, higher duty factors, and greater use of asymmetrical gaits. Additionally, vertical descent strategies reflected trade-offs among body mass, limb proportions, and head mass. Using a morphology-based model, we then inferred possible descent behaviors in 13 extinct euarchontoglires. Our results suggest that ancestral adaptations for vertical locomotion may have promoted frequent upright (head-up) postures in early primates.",

Aligned to this volume, we examined the expression patterns of neuronal populations representing many of the classical neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (GABA, acetylcholine, serotonin, and octopamine/tyramine), as well as a subset of neuropeptides (allatostatin A, crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), FMRFamide, proctolin) – detailing immunoreactivity in an unbiased fashion throughout the synganglion to reveal co-expression in known structures (such as the arcuate body), as well as novel neuropils not readily apparent in prior spider research, including the tonsillar neuropil as well as a potential protocerebral bridge. These structures provide targets for future functional studies, and taken together, could represent a spider equivalent of the central complex, contributing to behaviors such as web-building.",

Human Piezo2 contains seven domains that are alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific fashion resulting in the expression of at least 22 distinct variants. Despite the relevance of Piezo2 in human physiology, its sensitivity to membrane tension, and how this fundamental biophysical property is affected by alternative splicing, are unknown. Here, we use cell-attached pressure-clamp electrophysiology combined with differential interference contrast microscopy to quantify the response of Piezo2 to membrane tension and identify the alternatively spliced exon 35 as a domain sufficient to confer high sensitivity to membrane tension and cellular indentation. We further show that physiological variants of Piezo2 sense mechanical forces with distinct sensitivities and dynamic ranges. Together, our findings rationalize how Piezo2 variants may fulfill distinct physiological functions required for somatosensation and interoception.",

This article focuses on a different source of bias in LLMs—government censorship. By comparing foundation models developed in China and those from outside China, we find substantially higher rates of refusal to respond, shorter responses, and inaccurate responses to a battery of 145 political questions in China-originating models. These disparities diminish for less-sensitive prompts, showing that technological and market differences cannot fully explain this divergence. While all models exhibit higher refusal to respond rates with Chinese-language prompts than English ones, language differences are less pronounced than disparities between China-originating and non-China-originating models. We caution that our study is observational and cross-sectional and does not establish a causal linkage between regulatory pressures and censorship behaviors of China-originating LLMs, but these results suggest that censorship through government regulation requiring companies to restrict political content may be an important factor contributing to political bias in LLMs.</span>",

        "abstract": "Enveloped virus invasion relies on spike glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion. Cholesterol that serves crucial roles in modulating protein conformations and membrane properties, plays an essential role in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cell entry. However, the precise regulatory mechanism of cholesterol in SARS-CoV-2 fusion remains unknown. Here, using an in vitro vesicle-vesicle content mixing assay, we demonstrated that the addition of cholesterol enhanced SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated vesicle-vesicle fusion, with this enhancement being dependent on the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of spike. Further single-vesicle analyses demonstrate this enhancement primarily stems from increased docking probability, with cholesterol exerting mild effect on fusion probabilities. In the cell-based membrane fusion assay, cholesterol depletion from spike containing membrane significantly reduces syncytia formation and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, indicating its modulatory role in this process. Using structured illumination microscopy (SIM) based super-resolution imaging and single-molecule photobleaching microscopy, we demonstrated that spike proteins tended to form into an oligomeric cluster in the presence of cholesterol, likely through the interaction between cholesterol and palmitoylated cysteine rich region (CRR) in the C-terminus of spike. Last, substitution of residues of CRR with alanine in the C-terminus of spike abolished both the cholesterol-induced spike clustering and the cholesterol-dependent enhancement of vesicle docking. Taken together, our results suggest that cholesterol may induce the oligomerization of spike through specific interactions with its CRR, with this structural clustering critically mediating viral docking to host cell membranes, thereby promoting the subsequent membrane fusion and viral entry processes.",

To investigate how wildlife images influence online behavior, we combined behavioral experiments, neuroimaging data, and large-scale social media engagement data from National Geographic’s Instagram. Consistent with findings on charitable giving to humans, activity in brain circuits associated with anticipatory affect (i.e. the nucleus accumbens or NAcc) and value integration (i.e. the medial prefrontal cortex or MPFC) predicted individual liking and donations to depicted wildlife. Further, group MPFC activity forecast aggregate engagement (i.e. likes controlling for followers) with wildlife images on social media. Auxiliary analyses indicated that neural activity in circuits associated with socioemotional processing (i.e. facial salience and mentalizing) correlated with MPFC activity. In a neurally inspired model, these socioemotional features forecast social media engagement in other wildlife images online. Together, these findings imply that neural activity not only forecasts engagement with wildlife imagery on social media but can also inform theoretical models of which wildlife image features most powerfully promote sustainable behavior.</span>",

        "abstract": "Microfossils from the Paleoarchean Eon are the oldest known evidence of life. Despite their significance in understanding the history of life on Earth, any interpretation of the nature of these microfossils has been a point of contention among researchers. Decades of back-and-forth arguments led to the consensus that reconstructing the lifecycles of Archaean Eon organisms is the most promising way of understanding the nature of these microfossils. Here, we transformed a Gram-positive bacterium into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state and studied it under environmental conditions prevalent on early Earth. Using this approach, we successfully reconstructed morphologies and life cycles of Archaean microfossils. In addition to reproducing microfossil morphologies, we conducted experiments that spanned years to understand the process of cell degradation and how Archaean cells could have undergone encrustation of minerals (in this case, salt), leading to their preservation as fossilized organic carbon in the rock record. These degradation products strongly resemble fossiliferous features from Archaean rock formations. Our observations suggest that microfossils aged between 3.8–2.5 Ga most likely were liposome-like protocells that have evolved physiological pathways of energy conservation but not the mechanisms to regulate their morphology. Based on these observations, we propose that morphology is not a reliable indicator of taxonomy in these microfossils.",

        "abstract": "Understanding bacterial behavior in confined environments is helpful for elucidating microbial ecology and developing strategies to manage bacterial infections. While extensive research has focused on bacterial motility on surfaces and in porous media, chemotaxis in confined spaces remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the chemotaxis of Escherichia coli within microfluidic lanes under a linear concentration gradient of L-aspartate. We demonstrate that E. coli exhibits significantly enhanced chemotaxis in lanes with sidewalls compared to open surfaces. We attribute this phenomenon primarily to the intrinsic chiral clockwise circular motion of surface-swimming bacteria and the subsequent alignment effect upon collision with the sidewalls. By varying lane widths, we identify that an 8 m width--approximating the radius of bacterial circular swimming on surfaces--maximizes chemotactic drift velocity. These results are supported by both experimental observations and stochastic simulations, establishing a clear proportional relationship between optimal lane width and the radius of bacterial circular swimming. Further geometric analysis provides an intuitive understanding of this phenomenon. Our results may offer insights into bacterial navigation in complex biological environments such as host tissues and biofilms, providing a preliminary step toward exploring microbial ecology in confined habitats and potential strategies for controlling bacterial infections.",

        "abstract": "Rats exhibit significant recovery of locomotor function following incomplete spinal cord injuries, albeit with altered gait expression and reduced speed and stepping frequency. These changes likely result from and give insight into the reorganization within spared and injured spinal circuitry. Previously, we developed computational models of the mouse spinal locomotor circuitry controlling speed-dependent gait expression (Danner et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2022). Here, we adapted these models to the rat and used the adapted model to explore potential circuit-level changes underlying altered gait expression observed after recovery from two different thoracic spinal cord injuries (lateral hemisection and contusion) that have roughly comparable levels of locomotor recovery (Danner et al., 2023). The model reproduced experimentally observed gait expression before injury and after recovery from lateral hemisection and contusion and suggests two distinct, injury-specific routes to restored function. First, recovery after lateral hemisection required substantial functional restoration of damaged descending drive and long propriospinal connections, suggesting compensatory plasticity through formation of detour pathways. Second, recovery after a moderate midline contusion predominantly relied on reorganization of spared sublesional networks and altered control of supralesional cervical circuits, compensating for weakened propriospinal and descending pathways. Despite these differences, sensitivity analysis revealed that restored activation of sublesional lumbar rhythm-generating circuits and appropriately balanced lumbar commissural connectivity are the key determinants of post-injury gait expression, suggesting that injury symmetry shapes how the cord reorganizes, but effective recovery in both cases depends on re-engaging these lumbar networks, which makes them prime targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared drug protection. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile, spatially structured settings. Migration, space, fluctuations, and environmental variability all have a significant impact on the development and proliferation of AMR. While drug resistance is enhanced by migration in static conditions, this changes in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. Here, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment. This contains a toxin against which protection can be shared (cooperative AMR). Cells migrate between demes and connect them. When the environment and the deme composition vary on the same timescale, strong population bottlenecks cause fluctuation-driven extinction events, countered by migration. We investigate the influence of migration and environmental variability on the AMR eco-evolutionary dynamics by asking at what migration rate fluctuations can help clear resistance and what are the near-optimal environmental conditions ensuring the quasi-certain eradication of resistance in the shortest possible time. By combining analytical and computational tools, we answer these questions by determining when the resistant strain goes extinct across the entire metapopulation. While dispersal generally promotes strain coexistence, here we show that slow-but-nonzero migration can speed up and enhance resistance clearance, and determine the near-optimal conditions for this phenomenon. We discuss the impact of our findings on laboratory-controlled experiments and outline their generalisation to lattices of any spatial dimension.  Author summaryAs the number of microbes resisting antimicrobial drugs grows alarmingly, it is of paramount importance to tackle this major societal issue. Resistant microbes often inactivate antibiotic drugs in the environment around them, and hence offer protection to drug-sensitive bacteria in a form of cooperative behaviour. Moreover, microbes typically are distributed in space and live in time-changing environments, where they are subject to random fluctuations. Environmental variability, fluctuations, and spatial dispersal all have a strong influence on the drug resistance of microbial organisms. Here we investigate the temporal evolution of antimicrobial resistance in time-varying spatial environments by combining computational and mathematical means. We study the dynamics of drug-resistant and sensitive cells in the presence of an antimicrobial drug, when microbes are spatially distributed across a (two-dimensional) grid of well-mixed sub-populations (demes). Cells migrate between neighbouring demes, connecting these sub-populations, and are subject to sudden changes of environment, homogeneously across all demes. We show that when the environment and the deme composition vary on the same timescale, the joint effect of slow migration and fluctuations can help eradicate drug resistance by speeding up and enhancing the extinction probability of resistant bacteria. We also discuss how our findings can be probed in laboratory experiments, and outline their generalisation to lattices of any dimension.",

        "abstract": "Osmotic fragility (OF) is widely used to evaluate red blood cell (RBC) membrane stability, water transport dynamics and hemoglobinopathies, traditionally via spectrophotometric, visual, or flow cytometric techniques. Here, we present a novel flow chamber-based platform integrated with a proprietary imaging software providing AI-driven RBC detection for automated and reproducible OF analysis (BioExP). To assess agreement, we compared MCF₅₀ values from four healthy donors using classical and flow chamber methods. Protocol optimization included determining the “satiation time” (optimal incubation required to induce maximal hemolysis without overexposure) and hemolysis kinetics. Biological sensitivity was tested using two modulators: HgCl₂ (40 µM) to inhibit aquaporin (AQP) channels and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1000 µg/mL) to increase membrane fragility. Both treatments caused significant shifts in MCF₅₀ when compared to control: AQP inhibition decreased MCF₅₀ to 0.37 ± 0.01% NaCl (flow chamber) and 0.40 ± 0.01% NaCl (classical), while LPS increased MCF₅₀ to 0.44 ± 0.01% NaCl and 0.47 ± 0.004% NaCl, respectively (p < 0.001 for all). The BioExP replicated classical OF measurements, captured donor-specific variability, and detected changes. Importantly, it demonstrated that LPS alone, in plasma-free conditions, can compromise RBC membrane integrity.

Here we study how compartment size and channel gating interact to shape voltage dynamics and ion content in sub-micron structures. In small compartments, assumptions underlying conductance-based (Hodgkin-Huxley type) models of membrane voltage must be relaxed: [1] stochastic gating of individual ion channels can quickly and substantially change membrane voltage; [2] these changes can equilibrate faster than channel state transitions; and [3] ionic currents, even through as few as two channels, can substantially alter ionic concentrations. We adapted conductance-based models to incorporate these effects, and we then simulated voltage dynamics of small vesicles as a function of vesicle radius and channel density. We identified regimes in this parameter space with qualitatively distinct dynamics. We then performed stochastic simulations to explore the role of NaV1.5 in maturation of macrophage endosomes. The stochastic model predicted dramatically different dynamics compared to a deterministic approach. Electrophysiology of nanoscale structures can be very different from larger structures, even when ion channel composition and density are preserved.  SIGNIFICANCEWith tools of optical electrophysiology, one can measure and perturb membrane voltage in sub-micron structures. Recent experiments in organelles, dendritic spines, and bacteria motivate a re-examination of basic assumptions about bioelectrical phenomena in these compartments. This paper provides a framework for predicting and interpreting bioelectrical dynamics in small structures.",

In this study, we employ constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations to investigate the pH-dependent behavior of a 13-residue-long positively charge AMP, GL13K, focusing on the deprotonation states of lysine residues in a single GL13K AMP and their impact on its structural dynamics. We determine pKa values of the critical lysine residues and show that the last lysine located near the C-terminus (LYS11) has a significant deprotonation difference with other lysine residues. We observe that increasing the pH results in changes in the metastable conformational states including collapse of the peptide and highlight the stabilization of a potentially therapeutically-relevant {beta} hairpin configuration in pH levels leading to partial protonation of the lysines. Overall, our study shows the pH-dependent conformational dynamics and pKa variations of lysine residues in the GL13K antimicrobial peptide, providing critical insights into its structural behavior in solution. These findings establish a necessary rigorous foundation for further exploration of GL13K in more complex systems, advancing its potential development as an antimicrobial agent.",

        "abstract": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability, and wearers' perception of their bodies. While these devices can empower the wearer's motor performance, there is limited understanding of how they affect the wearer's conscious, subjective experience of their own body (or body image), especially with regard to dynamic movements. This study examined changes in perceived body image as individuals learned to walk with a robotic leg over multi-day training. We measured gait performance and perceived body image via the selected coefficient of perceived motion after each training session. By extending human motor learning theory to wearer–robot systems, we hypothesized that perceived body image when walking with a robotic leg co-evolves with actual gait improvement and becomes more certain and more accurate to actual motion. Our results confirmed that motor learning improved both physical and perceived gait patterns toward normal, indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into their sensorimotor systems to improve wearer–robot movement coordination. However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained, likely due to the absence of direct sensation/control of the prosthesis. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at later training sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequently calibrating the perception of body image are essential for effective training with wearable robots and for developing embodied assistive technologies.</span>",

It is increasingly clear that part of this migration is driven by endogenous electrochemical fields which point towards the center of skin wounds and guide collective cell migration through \"electrotaxis\". Mounting evidence suggests exogenously applied electric fields can accelerate healing, but progress in this field has been limited by the use of brute-force, global stimulation strategies that are wound agnostic and reflect neither the collective nature of the healing process nor the dynamic nature of the wound geometry. Here, we develop an experimental system to study how monolayer mouse skin responds to spatiotemporally patterned electric fields. We first show that local electrical stimulation can produce near global cell migration responses arising from cell-cell mechanical adhesion. We apply this strategy to 2D circular wounds using a local ring electric field near the wound edge and reveal how to tune the timing of local stimulation to avoid cellular jamming. Finally, we integrate our findings with a biophysics-informed optimal control strategy to tune both when and where the electric field should be applied in time, resulting in dramatic improvements to healing.",

In this work, we introduce Koffee Unbinding Kinetics as a solution to the hitherto unanswered problem of scalable ligand-protein residence time prediction. By bypassing conventional approaches based on molecular dynamics simulations, Koffee Unbinding Kinetics performs physics-based residence time screening at the atomistic level in {approx} 1 GPU minute per complex using inexpensive hardware, a speed-up of at least 3 - 5 orders of magnitude compared to current state-of-the-art simulation approaches.

        "abstract": "Elastic and viscoelastic properties of extracellular matrices (ECM) are known to regulate cellular behavior and mechanosensation differently, with implications for morphogenesis, wound healing, and pathophysiology. Most in vitro cellular processes, including cell migration, are studied on linear-elastic substrates to mimic extracellular matrices. However, most tissues are viscoelastic and display a loss modulus (G) that may be 10-20% of their storage modulus (G) under biophysically relevant conditions. Recent research has shown that cells can distinguish between elastic and viscoelastic ECM, leading to alterations in their cellular morphology, migration rates, and contractility. Here, we present a protocol for creating PAH-based model ECMs that enables the fabrication of viscoelastic substrates with storage moduli similar to those of their elastic counterparts. To explore how G influences epithelial cell mechanobiology, we fabricated tunable viscoelastic model ECMs with G of 3 kPa, 8 kPa, and 12 kPa, and for each, independently tuned G values to approximately 300 Pa, 500 Pa, and 700 Pa, respectively. We found that A549 cells cultured on stiff elastic model ECMs migrated [~]30% slower and formed larger focal adhesions compared to their viscoelastic counterparts. Conversely, A549 cells on intermediate viscoelastic model ECMs exhibited a [~]54% reduction in migration speed, with no significant difference in focal adhesion size relative to their elastic counterparts. These findings highlight the complex interplay between substrate (ECM) elastic and viscoelastic properties in regulating epithelial cell mechanobiology and emphasize the importance of time-dependent matrix mechanics in governing epithelial responses.",

        "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains the most common pediatric malignancy worldwide. Standard protocols such as BFM and GBTLI rely on long-established cytotoxic agents, yet novel targeted compounds have recently entered phase I/II trials. Despite these advances, no prior study has systematically compared the pharmacokinetic, ADMET, and quantum descriptor profiles of protocol-based drugs versus emerging clinical-phase agents. This study addresses that gap by integrating pharmacoinformatic and quantum-chemical approaches to highlight differences with potential clinical implications. We retrieved all small-molecule drugs from the BFM/GBTLI 2009 protocols and a representative set of phase I/II investigational compounds for pediatric ALL. In silico tools were used to assess physicochemical properties, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiles, and quantum chemical descriptors. We evaluated physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, including solubility, permeability, metabolic liabilities, and toxicity risks. Quantum chemical descriptors were calculated with density functional theory (DFT) to assess molecular reactivity (HOMO, LUMO, gap, dipole moment, electrophilicity). Multivariate analyses were applied to compare and cluster drug profiles. The comparative analysis revealed significant variability between guideline and clinical-phase compounds. Clinical-phase compounds generally exhibited higher molecular weight and lipophilicity, together with greater variability in permeability and solubility-related descriptors, indicating potential formulation and bioavailability challenges. Several investigational agents were identified as P-gp substrates and hERG inhibitors, suggesting increased risk of efflux-mediated resistance and cardiotoxicity. Quantum chemical analysis revealed that phase I/II compounds (e.g., Pelabresib, Molibresib) displayed smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps and higher electrophilicity, consistent with higher theoretical reactivity, whereas guideline drugs (e.g., Vincristine, Methotrexate) showed more stable electronic profiles. Cluster analysis confirmed distinct grouping between guideline and clinical-phase compounds. This in silico comparison integrates pharmacoinformatic and quantum descriptor analyses of established and emerging ALL therapeutics. By revealing key differences in drug-likeness, ADMET, and electronic reactivity, the study provides a comparative framework that may support the prioritization, optimization, and clinical translation of next-generation therapies for pediatric ALL.",

        "abstract": "We develop a three-dimensional dynamical-systems framework for passive gliding and identify the global phase-space structures that organize its motion. Extending previous two-dimensional models of non-equilibrium gliding, we show that the 3D velocity dynamics possess an attracting, normally hyperbolic invariant surface, the terminal velocity manifold (TVM), onto which all trajectories rapidly collapse before evolving slowly toward a glide equilibrium. There is also a separatrix surface associated with an invariant manifold of an unstable equilibrium within the TVM, which partitions initial conditions into qualitatively distinct descent behaviors: efficient shallow glides versus steep, drag-dominated descent. Using lift-drag data from three representative airfoils--a snake-inspired bluff body, the Zimmerman planform characteristic of Draco lizards, and the classical NACA 0012--we compute the full equilibrium surfaces, analyze their pitch-roll bifurcations, and reconstruct the TVM and separatrix geometry in three dimensions. The results reveal that (i) equilibrium stability changes with both pitch and roll, rather than pitch alone; (ii) separatrix geometry determines the dynamic accessibility of shallow glides; and (iii) bio-inspired airfoils possess compact separatrix regions that make efficient gliding robust across a wide range of initial jump conditions. This work unifies biological and engineered gliders within a single global geometric framework and establishes separatrix geometry on the TVM as a principled diagnostic for glide robustness.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how stick-slip dynamics manifests in diverse physical conditions is a crucial topic in tribology. Although it has been extensively studied in simple frictional configurations, the characterization of stick-slip behavior in complex assemblies is challenging. This work presents the first systematic investigation of stick-slip dynamics in a system with multiple contact surfaces undergoing friction amplification through conversion of traction forces into normal compression. Using interleaved paper blocks as a model system, we combine force measurements and image processing to characterize stick-slip events occurring when the two blocks are pulled apart at different detachment velocities. We find that both the peak force and the amplitude of the stick-slip events decrease along with the system's detachment. By combining a previously designed model for friction amplification and the stick-slip dynamics predicted by a simple frictional spring-block system, we link the observed behavior to the evolving normal compression within the assembly. Through force measurements and imaging, we extract the effective stiffness of the system from stick-slip events at low velocities and relate it to the system's normal compression. We then predict the observed decrease of the global stiffness as function of the detachment by considering the spatial distribution of normal forces within the assembly, which determines an effective number of sheets contributing to the system's mechanical response. Our findings reveal a non-trivial interplay between internal stress distribution and mechanical response mediated by frictional forces, with implications for granular materials, textiles, fibrous systems, and mechanical metamaterials.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14475v1",
        "abstract": "Microscale transport often relies on ubiquitous yet intrinsically random thermal fluctuations. Understanding how such fluctuations can be biased into directed motion has long been a central theme of nonequilibrium physics. Here, we introduce self-viscophoresis, a mechanism of autonomous motion based on the rectification of thermal fluctuations in a self-generated nonequilibrium viscosity field. Asymmetric colloidal particles dispersed in a thermoresponsive polymer solution induce local heating under uniform illumination, producing a spatially asymmetric viscosity profile around the particle and resulting in persistent directed motion. To elucidate the physical origin of this behavior, we develop a minimal Langevin model coupling isotropic thermal fluctuations to a dynamically updating temperature-viscosity field. The model shows that viscosity asymmetry anisotropically damps stochastic dynamics, effectively biasing thermal fluctuations into a net drift. It thus reproduces the observed directed motion without invoking deterministic propulsion terms associated with effective potentials or environmental fluid flows. Our results distinguish self-viscophoresis from conventional self-propulsion mechanisms and establish it as a general framework enabling reversible control of both the direction and dimensionality of motion.",

        "abstract": "Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of a self-propelled particle are typically hard-wired by its microscopic construction, limiting the range of behaviors accessible without redesigning the particle itself. Here we show that intramolecular nonreciprocity provides a minimal and versatile mechanism to overcome this constraint. We construct active molecules from short chains of two species of self-propelled particles whose propulsion directions are coupled nonreciprocally according to a prescribed internal sequence. At the single-molecule level, homogeneous sequences exhibit standard persistent random-walk dynamics, whereas heterogeneous sequences produce distinct trajectories inaccessible to either constituent species alone. At the collective level, using motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) as a representative example, we find that modifying the internal sequence shifts the MIPS onset by multiple orders of magnitude in propulsion strength, without altering particle-level interactions. These results demonstrate that intramolecular nonreciprocity among a small set of active components enables sequence-level programmability from single-molecule dynamics to emergent collective behavior, providing a minimal mechanism to encode and control active-matter dynamics across scales.",

        "abstract": "Spectral information plays a crucial role in biological imaging, yet conventional epifluorescence and histological techniques often rely on RGB image acquisition, limiting the resolution of spectrally overlapping components. Here, we present a phasor-based spectral analysis framework adapted for RGB images, enabling unsupervised segmentation and unmixing without the need for hyperspectral systems or sequential acquisition. By applying a discrete Fourier transform to the red, green, and blue intensities at each pixel, we generate a two-dimensional phasor plot where spectral relationships are encoded in modulation and phase. We demonstrate the utility of this approach across three distinct applications: segmentation of lung histology images stained with hematoxylin and eosin to quantify alveolar collapse, analysis of autofluorescence in skin lesions (nevi and melanoma) to highlight pathological spectral signatures, and spectral unmixing in multicolor-labeled U2OS cells to resolve overlapping fluorophores. Our method improves signal separation, reduces noise, and enhances biological interpretability using standard RGB acquisition. These findings establish RGB phasor analysis as a practical and powerful tool for spectral decomposition and segmentation in microscopy, bridging the gap between conventional imaging and advanced spectral analysis.",

However, it lacks atomic level structural detail. While AlphaFold has been successful in predicting monomeric protein structure, it can struggle with modeling protein complexes. To address these limitations, we developed a method that integrates IM-MS data with AlphaFold and Rosetta to improve complex structure prediction. Our approach uses experimental CCS data to guide the assembly of AlphaFold predicted subunits using a Rosetta docking pipeline and evaluating the resulting complexes with a newly developed score. Using this strategy, we were able to improve root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for 26 of 38 (68%) complexes compared to AlphaFold-Multimer. Furthermore, 16 of these systems improved significantly from greater than 4 [A] RMSD to less than 4 [A]. This method demonstrates a robust approach to overcome limitations in complex assembly modeling.  Table of Contents Graphic",

In bacteria, while several GTPases are known to participate in ribosome assembly, their precise mechanisms in subunit maturation and their potential roles in translation regulation remain largely elusive. Here, we report a series of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of native pre-50S assembly intermediates and 70S translating ribosomes, isolated via epitope-tagged GTPases from engineered Escherichia coli cells at resolutions of 2.3-4.4 [A]. These structures elucidate how three GTPases, YihA, EngA and ObgE, act as successive placeholders to mediate rRNA folding and to coordinate the correct timing of the maturation of different functional blocks within the large ribosomal subunit. Furthermore, our data identify several previously unrecognized 70S translational complexes bound by the GTPases EngA and BipA--factors traditionally regarded as assembly factors, thereby uncovering their regulatory role in bridging ribosome assembly and translation initiation. Collectively, our findings delineate a GTPase-mediated surveillance system that continuously monitors the assembly of ribosomal subunits and translation adversity, thereby safeguarding protein synthesis and maintaining proteome homeostasis.",

Large differences in the monolayer pressure-area isotherms are observed upon light-induced conformational switch of the spiropyran moiety of the sterol-spiropyran compound in the monolayer. We present evidence that the kinetics of monolayer response to photoisomerisation is controlled by the monolayer compressional (dilatational) elasticity. The results suggest that these sterol-spiropyran conjugates would likely readily incorporate in more complex lipid systems such as bilayers and could provide a coupling mechanism to control their properties, lateral organisation and morphology by light.",

A single operator can produce and analyze hundreds of isotopically labeled proteins per week, with per-sample cost largely defined by DNA synthesis. To benchmark this approach, we experimentally characterized 384 de novo designed proteins spanning diverse regions of structure space. High-quality two-dimensional NMR spectra were obtained for 239 samples (62% of designs overall). NMR characterization confirmed that the designed proteins adopt their intended folds, and revealed unexpected local dynamics that are not captured by current computational models. Our approach establishes a foundation for data-driven modelling of sequence-structure-dynamics relationships and unlocks a new regime of statistical structural biology, where insight into protein biophysics is gained from experimental ensemble studies of suitably designed protein clusters.",

        "abstract": "Biologically plausible learning mechanisms have implications for understanding brain functions and engineering intelligent systems. Inspired by the multi-scale recurrent connectivity in the brain, we introduce an adjoint propagation (AP) framework, in which the error signals arise naturally from recurrent dynamics and propagate concurrently with forward inference signals. AP inherits the modularity of multi-region recurrent neural network (MR-RNN) models and leverages the convergence properties of RNN modules to facilitate fast and scalable training. This framework eliminates the biologically implausible feedback required by the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, and allows concomitant error propagation for multiple tasks through the same RNN. We demonstrate that AP succeeds in training on standard benchmark tasks, achieving accuracies comparable to BP-trained networks while adhering to neurobiological constraints. The training process exhibits robustness, maintaining performance over extended training epochs. Importantly, AP supports flexible resource allocation for multiple cognitive tasks, consistent with observations in neuroscience. This framework bridges artificial and biological learning principles, paving the way for energy-efficient intelligent systems inspired by the brain and offering a mechanistic theory that can guide experimental investigations in neuroscience.",

        "abstract": "Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are heteropentameric chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brainstem and spinal cord, where they regulate motor and sensory processes. GlyRs are clustered in the postsynaptic membrane by strong interactions of the β subunit with the scaffold protein gephyrin. Even though <i>Glrb</i> mRNA is highly expressed throughout the brain, the existence of synaptic GlyRs remains controversial as there is little conclusive evidence using conventional fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiological recordings. Here, we exploit the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) to investigate the presence of GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the brain, focusing on several areas of the telencephalon. Making use of a knock-in mouse model expressing endogenous mEos4b-tagged GlyRβ, we identified few GlyRs in sub-regions of the hippocampus. Dual-colour SMLM revealed that these sparse receptors are integrated within the postsynaptic gephyrin domain, pointing to a possible role in maintaining the structural integrity of inhibitory synapses. In contrast, we found functionally relevant numbers of synaptic GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the ventral striatum. Our results highlight the strength of SMLM to detect few and sparsely distributed synaptic molecules in complex samples and to analyse their organisation with high spatial precision.",

        "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are essential molecular machines whose conformational dynamics have largely been inferred from ensemble-averaged measurements. Resolving dynamic heterogeneity and transient intermediates, however, requires single-molecule approaches. Here, we use single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to directly monitor conformational changes of the heterodimeric type IV ABC transporter TmrAB, a functional homolog of the human antigen transporter TAP. Fluorophores positioned at the nucleotide-binding domains and the periplasmic gate were validated by accessible-volume simulations, fluorescence lifetimes, and ensemble FRET, demonstrating that these reporters reliably track conformational transitions. Single-molecule analysis distinguishes ATP-free and ATP-bound states and reveals ATP-dependent population shifts from nucleotide-free to physiological ATP concentrations. Probing conformational dwell-times further uncovers an unexpectedly long ATP-bound dwell time of [~]300 ms. Using complementary stabilization strategies-including a slow-turnover variant, Mg{superscript 2} depletion, or substrate trans-inhibition-we resolve a previously hidden outward-facing open state that rapidly interconverts with occluded intermediates under turnover conditions. These results provide the first single-molecule characterization of TmrAB and establish a general framework for dissecting ATP-coupled conformational dynamics in heterodimeric ABC transporters.",

        "abstract": "Phenotypic heterogeneity in microbes can be a double-edged sword -- boosting individual survival in uncertain environments, but potentially compromising beneficial population coordination. Dissecting how microbes resolve this tradeoff is challenging because interactions span multiple scales--from molecular interactions to single-cell behavior, population dynamics, and environmental feedback. Here, we address this question for the Escherichia coli chemotaxis system, which implements both individual motile explorations and collective resource exploitations using the same cellular machinery. We quantify the heterogeneity of individual sensory and behavioral phenotypes, as well as the abundance of key signaling proteins during growth in various environments, and test their impact on population-scale collective migration. We identify growth rate as a key environment-dependent physiological variable governing not only the mean but also the variance of sensory phenotypes. Remarkably, rather than hindering population coordination, we find that sensory diversity benefits collective chemotactic navigation in uncertain environments. Strong heterogeneity of expressed phenotypes enhances readiness to multiple sensory cues, and the required population coordination is achieved by phenotypic filtering of that diversity by the collective behavior itself. These results reveal a sensory bet-hedging strategy for collective navigation during population growth: diversity in sensitivity to nutrients currently being consumed is reduced to promote focused exploitation, while it is increased for nutrients not yet encountered to enhance exploration for new growth opportunities.",

Hemodynamic fMRI (1H-based) provides whole-brain maps of activity, yet its vascular origin creates spatial and temporal displacements from neuronal events that complicate interpretation, especially in disease conditions where neurovascular coupling is altered. Here, we developed an ultrafast 23Na fMRI platform at 14 T that combines a reshuffled k-t 3D gradient echo readout (TR/TE, 10ms/1ms) with an implantable RF coil and respiration-gated acquisition. This configuration provides the sampling rate and SNR needed to probe quadrupolar T2*-weighted single quantum sodium dynamics on the neuronal timescale. Across rats and mice, somatosensory forepaw stimulation produced a localized 23Na signal decrease of ~2-3% in the FP-S1, peaking ~10-30 ms post-stimulus. The activity pattern is well matched with conventional BOLD-fMRI maps acquired in the same animals. Trial-by-trial measurements during simultaneous iGluSnFR glutamate fiber photometry demonstrated that larger evoked glutamate transients coincided with larger NARS decreases, supporting a neuronal origin of the NARS contrast. We interpret the negative NARS response as a transient activity-dependent redistribution of sodium ions toward restricted, protein-rich microdomains, where more restricted rotational dynamics may accelerate T2*short decay and produce a 2-3% signal decrease without requiring large changes in bulk sodium concentration. Together, these results establish neural activity-related sodium (NARS) fMRI as a viable approach for direct, mesoscale neuronal mapping with MRI at millisecond resolution.",

        "abstract": "Variants in ACTB gene encoding for cytoplasmic {beta}-actin result in a group of rare disorders called non-muscle actinopathies (NMA). We investigated the cellular effects of a missense variant, G302A, and a four-amino-acid deletion, S338-I341, associated with the subgroup of NMA - ACTB pLoF (predicted loss-of-function) disorder in patient-derived fibroblast cells. We found that neither of the mutations affected the organization of actin or the width of the actin-filament bundles, while the mutation G302A reduced the stiffness of the cells as measured by using atomic force microscopy. The latter effect might be associated with the misorganization of tubulin and with the increased size and number of focal adhesions. When we challenged the cells by monolayer stretching and followed the mechanically-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, we found that G302A mutant cells showed more dense actin filament bundles within the cells compared to wild type cells. At the same time, the extent of cofilin reorganization from the cell periphery was increased upon stretch, and this correlated with an increased cofilin phosphorylation. In the case of the deletion, while the extent of cofilin phosphorylation increased, the extent of reorganization was unaltered; rather, the phosphorylation of myosin light chain, important in counteracting external force, was drastically reduced. We could partially rescue this fascinating effect by overexpressing the active form of the formin mDia. Our findings open the possibility to validate the cellular phenotype in the most affected patients cells, in neurons.",

        "abstract": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values can be used to estimate the viral burden of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and predict population-level epidemic trends. We investigated the use of epidemic transmission modeling and machine learning (ML) based on Ct value distribution for SARS-CoV-2 incidence prediction in British Columbia, Canada during an Omicron subvariant BA.1-predominant period from November 2021 to January 2022. Using real-world data, we developed an epidemic transmission model that was first validated on outbreak data, and subsequently fitted to province-level data to predict incidence. Using simulated data, we developed a ML pipeline including five models to predict the reproductive number as a measure of transmission potential based on Ct value distribution, and validated it on out-of-sample province-level data. The epidemic transmission model demonstrated accurate prediction with the real incidence falling within the 95% credible interval of the predicted MCMC chains for both the long-term care facility outbreak, and province-level data. The ML models demonstrated good performance with a median mean squared error (MSE) lower than 0.17 across all models, and improved performance with increasing sample size. The variability of the Ct distribution around the mean was the strongest predictor of the reproductive number. These modeling approaches demonstrated utility for incidence and reproductive number prediction, and have potential to complement traditional surveillance in real time to guide public health interventions.",

        "abstract": "The doubly knotted motif is one of the least expected features in proteins, occurring in both globular and transmembrane forms. Here, we focus on globular protein members of the methyltransferase family: the TrmD-Tm1570 protein, which contains two deep 31 knots, and the single-knotted proteins TrmD and Tm1570, all from Calditerrivibrio nitroreducens. Using various biophysical experimental techniques and computer simulations with AI-based methods, we studied their thermal and thermodynamic stability, as well as their mechanical unfolding. Based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with the Structure-Based C Model (SBM-C) and UNRES (coarse-grained), we show that native contacts alone are not sufficient to fold double-knotted proteins. However, native contacts are sufficient to fold the single-knotted proteins TrmD and Tm1570 into their native conformations. Using the same model, we identified four possible unfolding and untying pathways, in which each domain can self-tie independently at some stage of the process. Optical tweezers (OT) experiments show that this process is also reversible, although the stretched state remains knotted. In addition, we observed higher thermal and mechanical stability in Tm1570 compared with TrmD, which is partly attributable to the position of the knot core. Overall, our results suggest that double-knotted protein from the SPOUT family can only partially self-fold, and that full knotting may require the assistance of a chaperone.",

        "abstract": "We develop a fully coupled theoretical description of dislocation dynamics on deformable crystalline surfaces, using continuum modeling and the amplitude-phase-field crystal (APFC) framework extended to curved geometries. We derive a general kinematic expression for dislocation velocity directly from the complex-amplitude evolution equations, which is also applicable to deformed surfaces through curvature-modified differential operators. From numerical simulations, we show that even small out-of-plane deformations reshape the phenomenology of defect motion through curvature-induced self-propulsion, modified glide directions, and non-classical defect-defect interactions. Our results show how surface geometry profoundly influences defect dynamics and establish the surface-APFC model as a powerful framework for predicting and interpreting curvature-defect coupling across a wide range of systems, from stiff but deformable layers to soft matter surfaces and membranes that retain crystalline order.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) based on fluorescent proteins (FPs) report membrane potential changes through voltage-driven conformational rearrangements of a voltage-sensing domain that perturb the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding environment of a fused FP chromophore. While the chromophore is largely protected from the external environment by the FP {beta}-can, previous results suggest that this structure can also act as a programmable electrostatic grid that influences chromophore flexibility and fluorescence transition states. Here, we show that varying the external polar offset of {beta}-sheet residues flanking a chromophore-proximal position systematically reshapes fluorescence transitions, altering response polarity and kinetics. Importantly, the influence of these external residues depends strongly on the internal sidechain chemistry, revealing reciprocal coupling between {beta}-sheet electrostatics and chromophore-proximal residues. We further show that the functional effects of glutamine and asparagine substitutions at this position are strongly context-dependent and can be tuned by appropriate external polar offsets, consistent with electrostatic control of internal sidechain orientation and expanding the molecular switch repertoire. Disrupting steady-state fluorescence further revealed that the secondary component of the voltage-dependent fluorescence transition is preferentially light-sensitive and can be selectively diminished by repeated stimulation, indicating that it arises from a photophysically distinct process separable from the primary response. In addition, altering the chromophore protonation equilibrium (e.g., T65S) substantially changes response kinetics, indicating that chromophore state influences how {beta}-can electrostatics couple to fluorescence transitions. Together, these results define general programming rules by which the electrostatic grid of the FP {beta}-barrel can be tuned to control chromophore optical properties both at rest and during perturbation of the steady state.",

        "abstract": "Tofu remains one of the worlds most important plant-based foods, famous for its cultural legacy, nutritional benefits, and environmental sustainability. Made up of only two ingredient-soy beans and water-it has nourished people for centuries; yet, its rheology remains incompletely understood. Here, we use tofu as a minimal model system to study how composition governs the mechanics and physics of hydrated soft solids. We perform over a hundred controlled compression tests on silken, firm, and extrafirm tofu, and observe a strong nonlinearity, a pronounced viscoelasticy, and a more than ten-fold increase in stress with only six percent decrease in water content. We demonstrate that automated model discovery can identify inelastic constitutive laws that accurately capture these unique characteristics across multiple loading magnitudes and rates. The discovered models autonomously separate elastic and inelastic mechanisms and reveal that tofu elasticity depends primarily on the second isochoric invariant, while tofu inelasticity depends on a combination of the second and third deviatoric invariants. This functional form is universal across all three tofu types, but scales in magnitude with water content. Our new water-content-based feature network reveals that this correlation in not linear, as assumed by traditional bi-phasic theories, but rather highly non-linear and sensitive to the individual model terms. These results position tofu as a quantitative benchmark for nonlinear poroviscoelastic solids and demonstrate how physics-informed machine learning can uncover the constitutive structure of hydrated soft materials.

For cellular chemical reaction networks, this means optimising a variety of fitness functions such as robustness, precision, or sensitivity to external stimuli. We argue that these diverse goals can be achieved by a versatile, generic mechanism: coupling chemical reaction networks to reservoirs that are strongly out of equilibrium. Using theory and numerics we show that this mechanism of optimization comes at the price of significant heat dissipation. We compute the heat flux caused by kinetic proof-reading in Escherichia coli and show that it constitutes a significant fraction of the total heat flux experimentally measured in this model organism. We then demonstrate that the degree of optimality achievable saturates, and that Nature appears to operate near saturation despite high energetic costs. We conclude that  life is hot largely because of the need for a versatile mechanism to optimise a variety of fitness functions.",
