## Metabolites Shift Equilibria of Biomolecular Condensates

Metabolites are abundant in cells, where condensation of proteins and nucleic acids can organize cellular contents without membranes. Condensates form and dissolve dynamically in response to diverse cellular processes. Understanding condensate phase behavior using full phase diagrams is hampered by the sheer number of distinct molecular species involved. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce susceptibility, a dimensionless descriptor that quantifies dilute-phase responses to solute perturbations and enables direct comparison across condensates. We measure how three model condensates, assembled by distinct cohesive mechanisms, respond to amino acids, nucleotides, and a crowder. We find that these small molecules generically modulate condensate phase equilibria, with susceptibilities spanning over five orders of magnitude. These magnitudes reflect underlying molecular interactions, consistent with theoretical descriptions of condensation including Flory-Huggins and polyphasic linkage theories. We extend susceptibility to multicomponent perturbations by expressing the response as a weighted sum of individual solute perturbations. Applying these principles, we exploit enzymatic activity to induce condensation and modulate material properties. Our work establishes metabolites as generic modulators of biomolecular condensates with relevance to cellular physiology and provides a framework for programming condensates with desired phase and material properties.

## Huygens' clocks at the microscale

Weakly coupled oscillators adjust their dynamics to work in unison: they synchronize. This ubiquitous phenomenon is observed for oscillating pendulum, electronic devices, as well as clapping crowds or flashing fireflies. In effect, synchronization constitutes an efficient mean to translate microscopic into large scale dynamics. While broadly studied theoretically, experimental investigations of synchronization of systems at the microscale are limited. Here we devise and study a model system of noisy and "measurably imperfect" colloidal oscillators: autonomous clocks made of an active swimmer revolving around a passive sphere. The distribution of natural frequency of the clock is achieved using passive spheres of various sizes, thus without altering the (phoretic) coupling between clocks. We observe that pairs of oscillators lock phases before slipping and returning to sync, and we characterize the synchronicity of the pair. We rationalize our findings with a stochastic model, formalizing synchronization as a classical Kramers escape problem in an adequate potential. This provides an analytical expression for the rate of synchronization of a pair set by the ratio between differences of natural frequency and environmental noise, and agrees qualitatively with the experiment. Our results set a blueprint for synchronization with micrometric autonomous systems.

## Injury-induced electrochemical coupling triggers organ growth

Organ injury triggers nonneuronal electric currents essential for regeneration. However, the mechanisms by which electrical signals are generated, sensed, and transmitted upon damage to promote organ growth remain unclear. Here, we uncover that organ repair relies on dynamic electrochemical coupling between membrane potential depolarization and intracellular signaling, essential to activate cell proliferation. By subsecond live imaging of locally injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across time and space: a millisecond, long-range, membrane depolarization gradient, followed by second-persistent intracellular calcium responses. In the subsequent hour, voltage sensing phosphatase senses the injury-driven membrane potential change and autonomously translates the electric signal intracellularly, promoting tissue-wide cell proliferation. Connecting these dynamics with an electrodiffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fin’s interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading. Our work reveals the coupling between fast electrical signals and slower intracellular signaling, ensuring complete organ recovery.
