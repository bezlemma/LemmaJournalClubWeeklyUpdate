<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The mitotic spindle is a biomechanical structure whose length must be precisely controlled to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. The treadmilling of microtubules towards centrosomes, termed poleward flux, is involved in spindle length control. However, poleward flux has been shown to be both inversely and directly proportional to spindle length, a contradiction that remains unexplained by current mechanisms. Here we introduce a model which demonstrates that length-dependent regulation at both microtubule ends allows plus- and minus-end dynamics to synchronize with one another, enabling pathways of poleward flux-based spindle length control which can rectify previous results. Moreover, our model predicts that spindle length and poleward flux can vary independently via simultaneous perturbations at both microtubule ends, which we experimentally validate with combinations of KIF18A, KIF2A, and KATNB1 depletions in human cells. Our results thus resolve a longstanding paradox and provide mechanistic insight into the reciprocal control of spindle length and poleward flux.

### Revealing Liquid-Gas Transitions with Finite-Size Scaling in Experimental and Simulation Systems Confined by an External Field

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The application of an external field often renders empirical criteria for identifying liquid-gas phase transitions ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that the finite-size scaling of the density profile provides a definitive criterion to distinguish liquid-gas coexistence from a single fluid phase in field-confined systems. Our scaling method collapses the density profiles of different system sizes onto a single master curve for a one-phase system, while causing the profiles to intersect at the interface in a two-phase system. We validate this theoretical proposal through experiments and simulations of two model systems: colloidal suspensions under gravity and two-dimensional complex plasmas confined by a central potential. Our method is broadly applicable for detecting liquid-gas phase transitions in laboratory systems where external fields are inherent.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
A new homologous series of mesogenic compounds with nearly linear mesogenic core was studied, and it showed a strong discrimination between nematic and smectic phases with respect to the length of terminal chain. For short homologues a ferroelectric nematic NF and a heliconical nematic NTBF phase were observed while for longer ones they were replaced with ferroelectric smectic AF and CF phases. The n = 3 homologue exhibits a unique sequence of SmCF to its heliconical analogue SmCPH . Replacing an alkyne linkage in the mesogenic core with an alkene one favored smectic phases and leads to appearance of a modulated-type SmAAF phase.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Histone trimethylation on the tail residue H3K9 of nucleosomes is a hallmark of constitutive heterochromatin. The mechanism how this mark is maintained over cell division cycles remains a topic of ongoing debate. The recent formulation of the polymer-assisted condensation (PAC) scenario, through which a stable droplet condensate can form as a reaction container for methylation reactions, has offered a novel approach to answer this longstanding question. In this letter we develop a kinetic proofreading argument for histone tail methylation which builds on the PAC model and yields support to the idea that liquid-liquid phase separation underlies the reconstitution of heterochromatin over cell division cycles.

### In vivo autofluorescence lifetime imaging of spatial metabolic heterogeneities and learning-induced changes in the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Neuronal energy regulation is increasingly recognized as a critical factor underlying brain functions and their pathological alterations, yet the metabolic dynamics that accompany cognitive processes remain poorly understood. As a label-free and minimally invasive technique, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of coenzymes NADH and NADPH (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H) offers the possibility to resolve cellular metabolic profiles with high spatial precision. However, NAD(P)H FLIM’s capacity to detect subtle variations in neuronal metabolism has not been demonstrated. In this study, we applied NAD(P)H FLIM to map the metabolic profiles of <i>Drosophila</i> neurons in vivo across multiple scales, focusing on the primary centers for associative memory: the mushroom bodies (MBs). At a broad scale, we obtained an overview of the metabolic signatures of the main brain tissue and identified a marked difference between neuropil and cortex areas. At a finer scale, our findings revealed notable heterogeneity in the basal metabolic profiles of distinct MB neuron subtypes. Measurements performed after associative olfactory learning also uncovered a low-magnitude subtype-specific metabolic shift associated with memory formation, suggesting the utility of NAD(P)H FLIM in detecting physiology-driven changes linked to brain function. These results establish a promising framework for studying the spatial heterogeneities and the dynamics of cerebral energy metabolism in vivo.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Coordinated forelimb actions, such as reaching and grasping, rely on motor commands that span a spectrum from abstract target selection to detailed instantaneous muscle control. The sensorimotor cortex is central to controlling these complex movements, yet how the detailed command signals are distributed across its numerous subregions remains unclear. In particular, in mice, it is unknown if the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices represent low-level joint angle details in addition to high-level signals like movement direction. Here, we combine high-quality markerless tracking and two-photon imaging during a reach-to-grasp task to quantify movement-related activity in the mouse forelimb M1 (M1-fl) and forelimb S1 (S1-fl). Linear decoding models reveal a strong representation of proximal and distal joint angles in both areas, and both areas support joint angle decoding with comparable fidelity. Despite shared low-level encoding, the time course of high-level target-specific information varied across areas. M1-fl exhibited early onset and sustained encoding of target-specific signals, while S1-fl was more transiently modulated around lift onset. These results reveal both shared and unique contributions of M1-fl and S1-fl to reaching and grasping, implicating a more distributed cortical circuit for mouse forelimb control than has been previously considered.

### Early-Enrichment Hit Discovery via Reversible-Work c(t) Estimation in Metadynamics (CTMD)

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Virtual screening for small-molecule binders is often limited by false positives from approximate scoring functions and rigid-receptor assumptions. These can be addressed downstream through accurate but expensive free energy calculations. At the same time, recent artificial-intelligence-based co-folding methods have been proposed that claim to achieve accuracy of free energy methods at much lower cost, but these have not yet delivered consistent improvements in early enrichment and can be confounded by memorization. Here we address this gap by introducing c(t)-based metadynamics (CTMD), a physics-based, high-throughput hit-triaging protocol tailored for early enrichment. CTMD uses the nonequilibrium reversible-work estimator c(t) introduced by Tiwary and Parrinello (Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2015 119 736), computed from a small number of short, independent well-tempered metadynamics trajectories, to rank binding stability without requiring converged binding free energies. Across diverse targets and chemotypes, CTMD provides robust early enrichment while remaining fast, transferable with minimal parameter tuning, and resistant to memorization-driven artifacts - underscoring both an immediately deployable physics-based alternative for screening. For these systems we show how co-folding, particularly Boltz-2, achieves enrichment directly proportional to similarity with training set, and more worrying, even in the presence of significant modifications to active site. Given its simplicity of implementation, CTMD should thus be an "embarassingly" open-source, early enrichment method available for use by the broad pharma and academic community that sits right between approximate but fast docking or AI based co-folding methods, and more expensive but accurate free energy calculations, expected to lead to saving significant financial and human capital in drug discovery campaigns.

### Bidirectional allosteric ligand regulation in a central glycolytic enzyme

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Allosteric regulation enables fine-tuned control of enzyme activity in response to cellular signals, yet its molecular basis often remains unclear. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK), the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is a paradigmatic, well-conserved system whose reaction kinetics conform to the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allostery. However, X-ray crystal structures of bacterial PFK orthologs in distinct ligand-bound states do not show the consistent, concerted structural rearrangements expected for classical "relaxed" and "tense" states, revealing a decades-long disconnect between structure and function. We resolve this paradox by integrating biophysical and computational approaches to show that activator and inhibitor binding to the same allosteric pocket differentially reweight the conformational ensemble of Escherichia coli PFK. Activator binding stabilizes conformational substates that preorganize the catalytic site, whereas inhibitor binding upweights apo-like, catalytically incompetent substates. These findings establish an ensemble-based mechanism for PFK regulation and provide an energetic framework for understanding the expanded allosteric architecture of higher PFK orthologs.

### Results of a large scale study of the binding of 50 type IIinhibitors to 348 kinases: The role of protein reorganization

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Kinase family proteins constitute the second largest protein class targeted in drug development efforts, most prominently to treat cancer, but also several other diseases associated with kinase dysfunction. In this work we focus on type II kinase inhibitors which bind to the "classical" inactive conformation of the protein kinase catalytic domain where the DFG motif has a ''DFG-out'' orientation and the activation loop is folded. Many Tyrosine kinases (TKs) exhibit strong binding affinity with a wide spectrum of type II inhibitors while serine/threonine kinases (STKs) often bind more weakly. Recent work suggests this difference is largely due to differences in the folded to extended conformational equilibrium of the activation loop between TKs vs. STKs. The binding affinity of a type II inhibitor to its kinase target can be decomposed into a sum of two contributions: (1) the free energy cost to reorganize the protein from the active to inactive state, and (2) the binding affinity of the type II inhibitor to the inactive kinase conformation. In previous work we used a Potts statistical energy potential based on sequence co variation to thread sequences over ensembles of active and inactive kinase structures. The threading function was used to estimate the free energy cost to reorganize kinases from the active to classical inactive conformation, and we showed that this estimator is consistent with the results of molecular dynamics free energy simulations for a small set of STKs and TKs. In the current study, we analyze the results of a large-scale study of the binding affinities of 50 type II inhibitors to 348 kinases, of which the results for 16 of the 50 type II inhibitors were reported in an earlier study (the "Davis dataset"). The binding data for the remaining 34 type II inhibitors to the panel of 348 kinases were recently obtained (the "Schrodinger dataset"). We use the Potts statistical energy model to investigate the contribution of protein reorganization to the selectivity of the large kinase panel against the set of 50 type II inhibitors, and find that protein reorganization makes a significant contribution to the selectivity. The AUC of the receiver operator characteristic curve is {approx}0.8. We report the results of an internal "blind test", that shows how Potts threading energies can provide more accurate estimates of kinase selectivity than corresponding predictions using experimental results of small sample size. We discuss why two STK phylogenetic kinase families, STE and CMGC, appear to contain many outliers, and how to improve the ability to predict kinase selectivity with a more complete analysis of the kinase conformational landscape. We compare the performance of Potts threading for predicting binding properties of the large set of (50) Type II inhibitors to 348 kinases, with those of a sequence-based purely machine learning model, DeepDTAGen, a publicly available machine learning model that was trained on the complete Davis dataset, including both Type I and Type II kinase inhibitors. We observe that DeepDTAGen performs well on binding predictions for the 16 type II inhibitors in the Davis dataset, but performs poorly on binding predictions for the 34 type II inhibitors against 348 kinases in the Schrodinger dataset.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Dengue virus (DENV) is a global disease threat with tropical regions bearing the bulk of disease burden. Presence of four DENV serotypes with varying antigenicity has complicated development of effective, pan-serotype strategies for prevention and treatment of dengue disease. Here, we report single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of DENV in complex with three human-derived broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), revealing an antibody class which preferentially uses its heavy chain for potency and antigen recognition. These heavy chain-driven E-dimer recognizing (HEDR) bnAbs potently neutralize all DENV serotypes by binding to a quaternary epitope encompassing the critical fusion loop and conserved glycans on DENV surface E-glycoprotein dimer. We also demonstrate the presence of capsule-shaped DENV, with HEDR antibodies binding such tubular morphologies in addition to spherical virions. Cryo-EM helical reconstructions of Fab-bound tubular virions from different DENV strains establishes that the pattern of E-glycoproteins helical arrangement is dependent solely on the virus strain. The structural data also demonstrate that binding of highly potent HEDR bnAb D14.F25.S02 causes distortion of DENV particles. Collectively, these results elucidate key features of HEDR bnAbs while illustrating the importance of eliciting immune responses that can neutralize diverse DENV morphologies.

### Single-nanoparticle electrophoretic mobility determination and trapping using active-feedback 3D tracking
**Source:** bioRxiv

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Nanoparticles (NP) are versatile materials with widespread applications across medicine and engineering. Despite rapid incorporation into drug delivery, therapeutics, and many more areas of research and development, there is a lack of robust characterization methods. Light scattering techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) use an ensemble-averaged approach to the characterization of nanoparticle size and electrophoretic mobility (EPM), leading to inaccuracies when applied to polydisperse or heterogeneous populations. To address this lack of single-nanoparticle characterization, this work applies 3D Single-Molecule Active Real-time Tracking (3D-SMART) to simultaneously determine NP size and EPM on a per-particle basis. Single-nanoparticle EPM is determined by using active feedback to lock on to a single particle and apply an oscillating electric field along one axis. A maximum likelihood approach is applied to extract the single-particle EPM from the oscillating nanoparticle position along the field-actuated axis, while mean squared displacement is used along the non-actuated axes to determine size. Unfunctionalized and carboxyl-functionalized polystyrene NPs are found to have unique EPM based on their individual size and surface characteristics, and it is demonstrated that single-nanoparticle EPM is a more precise tool for distinguishing unique NP preparations than diffusion alone, able to determine the charge number of individual NPs to an uncertainty of less than 30. This method also explored individual nanoparticle EPM in various ionic strengths (0.25-5 mM) and found decreased EPM as a function of increasing ionic strength, in agreement with results determined via bulk characterization methods. Finally, it is demonstrated that the electric field can be manipulated in real time in response to particle position, resulting in one-dimensional electrokinetic trapping. Critically, this new single-nanoparticle EPM determination and trapping method does not require microfluidics, opening the possibility for the exploration of single-nanoparticle EPM in live tissue and more comprehensive characterization of nanoparticles in biologically relevant environments.

### Learning millisecond protein dynamics from what is missing in NMR spectra

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Many proteins' biological functions rely on interconversions between multiple conformations occurring at micro- to millisecond (s-ms) timescales. A lack of standardized, large-scale experimental data has hindered obtaining a more predictive understanding of these motions. After curating >100 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxation datasets, we realized an observable for s-ms dynamics might be hiding in plain sight. Millisecond dynamics can cause NMR signals to broaden beyond detection, leaving some residues not assigned in the chemical shift datasets of ~10,000 proteins deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB). We made the bold assumption that residues missing assignments are exchange-broadened due to s-ms motions and trained various deep learning models to predict missing assignments. Strikingly, these models also predict exchange measured via NMR relaxation experiments, indicative of s-ms dynamics. The best of these models, which we named Dyna-1, leverages an intermediate layer of the multimodal language model ESM-3. Notably, dynamics directly linked to biological function -- including enzyme catalysis and ligand binding -- are particularly well predicted by Dyna-1, which parallels our findings that residues experiencing s-ms exchange are more conserved. We anticipate the datasets and models presented here will be transformative in unlocking the common language of dynamics and function.

### Unbend: Correction of local beam-induced sample motion in cryo-EM images using a 3D spline model

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The exposure of frozen biological samples to the high-energy electron beam in a cryo-electron microscope commonly leads to beam-induced sample motion and distortions. Previously, we described Unblur, which is part of our cisTEM software to correct for beam-induced motion based on the alignment of full frames in a movie collected during the beam exposure (Grant et al., 2015). However, Unblur cannot accommodate motion due to more localized sample bending and distortions. Here, we present Unbend, extending Unblur by incorporating local motion correction using a three-dimensional cubic spline model. The 3D spline model is constructed using cubic B-splines along the exposure time axis, and bicubic B-splines within movie frames. Unbend is integrated into our cisTEM software with a new local motion visualization panel within the cisTEM graphical user interface. We processed movie frames from various in-situ sample types, including whole cells, lamellae, and cell lysates, to analyze motion behavior across different specimen types. To quantify the improvement in high-resolution signal, we utilized the 2D template matching method, which operates independently of the motion correction process, to search large ribosomal subunits from the motion-corrected micrographs. Overall, the signal-to-noise ratio of detected particles improved by 3-8% across different samples compared with full-frame aligned micrographs, while the number of detected target particles increased by up to ~300%. The total and Von Mises equivalent strain shows a deformation scale of less than 1% in most of the samples, confirming that our model induces minimal additional distortion. Furthermore, we processed micrograph montages to study motion patterns across an entire sample, revealing considerable variance in distortion scale within the same sample, suggesting a complex underlying mechanism.

### Dynamical buffering of reconfiguration dynamics in intrinsically disordered proteins

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins are important for their function, allowing their heterogeneous conformational ensembles to rapidly reconfigure in response to binding partners or changes in solution conditions. However, the relation between sequence composition and chain dynamics has rarely been studied. Here, we characterize the dynamics of a set of 16 naturally occurring disordered regions of identical chain length but with highly diverse sequences. In spite of the strong variation of chain dimensions with sequence in this set inferred from single-molecule FRET, nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy yields chain reconfiguration times that are almost independent of sequence. This surprising observation contrasts with the slowdown in dynamics, attributed to internal friction, that has been observed in more compact disordered proteins. We investigated this effect with the aid of multi-microsecond, all-atom explicit-solvent simulations of all 16 disordered proteins. The simulations reproduce the experimental FRET efficiencies with near-quantitative accuracy, with explicit inclusion of the FRET dyes improving agreement with experiment while minimally perturbing the protein ensemble. Critically, the simulations also reproduce the lack of correlation between reconfiguration times and chain dimensions across the sequences and allow us to rationalize this observation as arising from two competing factors as the chains get more compact. The narrowing of end-to-end distance distributions and a concomitant reduction of the corresponding intrachain diffusion coefficients have opposite effects that end up resulting in only a small variation of reconfiguration times with chain dimensions. These compensating factors "buffer" the effect of sequence on linker dynamics, which may help to conserve function as sequences evolve.

### Structural basis for hydrolytic splicing of a circularly permuted group II intron

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that are considered the ancestors of the eukaryotic spliceosome. Unlike canonical group II introns that self-splice to generate linear exons and lariats, circularly permuted (CP) group II introns identified in various bacterial phyla perform back-splicing, resulting in the production of circular RNAs and branched products via branching pathway. Furthermore, CP introns may switch to a hydrolysis pathway resulting in distinct products to differentially regulate gene expression. In this study, we present biochemical data and high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a CP group II intron from Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 (Cte 1), allowing mechanistic dissection of the branching pathway switch to the hydrolysis pathway and enabling reconstruction of both both steps of the hydrolysis pathway. The structures reveal that CP undergoes the hydrolysis pathway upon mutations of the branch point or splice sites (SS) due to rearrangements in the active site. Here, the branching nucleotide in domain D6 is retracted from its catalytically competent conformation, giving way to the nucleophilic water molecule to attack the 5' splice site. Furthermore, we visualized the intermediates of the second splicing step, which reveal the movement of domain D6 out of the way for the 3'-splicing to occur, closely resembling the second-step structures of the branching pathway. Finally, our structures provide direct evidence for domains D1D2D3 acting as a scaffold in group II introns.Together, these findings visualize the complete hydrolysis pathway and offer a new strategy to engineer CP introns for circular RNA production, with potential applications in both basic research and therapeutic development.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Metabolites are abundant in cells, where condensation of proteins and nucleic acids can organize cellular contents without membranes. Condensates form and dissolve dynamically in response to diverse cellular processes. Understanding condensate phase behavior using full phase diagrams is hampered by the sheer number of distinct molecular species involved. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce susceptibility, a dimensionless descriptor that quantifies dilute-phase responses to solute perturbations and enables direct comparison across condensates. We measure how three model condensates, assembled by distinct cohesive mechanisms, respond to amino acids, nucleotides, and a crowder. We find that these small molecules generically modulate condensate phase equilibria, with susceptibilities spanning over five orders of magnitude. These magnitudes reflect underlying molecular interactions, consistent with theoretical descriptions of condensation including Flory-Huggins and polyphasic linkage theories. We extend susceptibility to multicomponent perturbations by expressing the response as a weighted sum of individual solute perturbations. Applying these principles, we exploit enzymatic activity to induce condensation and modulate material properties. Our work establishes metabolites as generic modulators of biomolecular condensates with relevance to cellular physiology and provides a framework for programming condensates with desired phase and material properties.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum relies on anaerobic glycolysis for energy during the intraerythrocytic stage, producing lactate and H+ that must be extruded via its formate-nitrite transporter (PfFNT) to prevent death by cytosolic acidification and swelling. Unlike bacterial homologues classified as channels, PfFNT mediates saturable lactate transport and was classified as a transporter, raising questions about its transport mechanism and what distinguishes channels from transporters. Here, we combine over 720 s of molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemical calculations, and transport assays in Xenopus laevis oocytes to characterize the transport cycle of PfFNT. We show a transport mechanism in which protonation of a central histidine (H230) enables lactate binding, and proton transfer from H230 to lactate is required to release the substrate as neutral lactic acid. This mechanism is supported by data indicating that neutral compounds such as lactamide do not enter the cavity, while anions like iodide, which are unlikely to protonate under physiological conditions, bind in the cavity but are not released and thus block lactate transport. As neither lactate nor lactic acid can diffuse passively through the protein, it is the requirement for proton transfer defines PfFNT as a lactate/H+ transporter rather than a channel. Notably, the PfFNT transport process occurs without significant protein conformational changes. Furthermore, our data indicates that under acidic conditions, small neutral molecules such as formic acid can passively diffuse through the protein. This suggests PfFNT challenges standard definitions of channels and transporters and differs from existing examples of channel-like transporters as it i) operates as a transporter without conformational changes and ii) can switch between transporter and channel modes within the same transport pathway.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are biomolecular condensates composed of diverse RNAs and RNA-binding proteins that play essential roles in regulating multiple aspects of RNA biology. As complex biological systems, the condensate functions of RNP granules emerge from the higher-order kinetic assembly of individual molecules. Here, we develop an in vitro single-molecule approach-termed SMART (group single-molecule assay for ribonucleoprotein granules) - that enables direct and quantitative measurements of RNP granule assembly and disassembly kinetics across nanoscale to mesoscale regimes. Using SMART, we reveal that RNP granule assembly is strongly pathway dependent. In parallel, we develop a minimal two-state mathematical model that faithfully reproduces these kinetic behaviors. This model enables quantification of multivalent interaction timescales, reconstruction of the underlying free-energy landscape governing RNP granule dynamics, and demonstrates that this assembly process is intrinsically non-equilibrium. Understanding the condensate functions of RNP granules suggests new strategies for their rational manipulation in health and disease.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Life is composed of genetic and functional polymers, such as nucleic acids. For life to have emerged, a prebiotic mechanism for assembling these polymers is essential. In a prebiotic environment teeming with diverse organic molecules, selecting, concentrating and bringing together only relevant building blocks poses a significant challenge. G-quadruplexes, a secondary structure of DNA and RNA, are known to self-assemble from nucleotide monomers, creating an ideal preassembly for nucleotide polymerization. We investigate the detailed structure of self-assembled G-quadruplexes using high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements in solution. We show that G-quadruplexes of nucleotide monomers are stable on surfaces in aqueous solution at concentrations orders of magnitude below their solubility limit. When subjected to cycles of evaporation and rehydration at elevated temperatures, the G-quadruplexes partially transform into extended, RNA-like structures, also stable on surfaces in solution, consistent with a polymeric nature. G-quadruplexes self-assembled from nucleotide monomers could have served as persistent prepolymer scaffolds, providing genuine molecular selectivity in prebiotic environments.

### Non-reciprocal Binary-fluid Turbulence

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Although effective non-reciprocal interactions have been investigated in a variety of fields, their consequences have not been explored in hydrodynamical turbulence. We initiate such an exploration by introducing non-reciprocal binary-fluid tubulence and uncover its properties by developing a two-dimensional (2D) Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (NRCHNS) model. We show that, as we increase the strength of the non-reciprocal terms, this model displays a hitherto unanticipated type of turbulence, with an inverse cascade of energy and an energy spectrum $E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$, reminiscent of the well-known inverse cascade in forced, 2D fluid turbulence, but distinct from it, in so far as it develops a non-reciprocal flux $\mathbf J$. We demonstrate how NRCHNS turbulence suppresses $J(t) = |\mathbf J|$, as the Reynolds number increases. We compare and contrast 2D NRCHNS turbulence with its fluid-turbulence counterpart by examining spectra, fluxes, spectral balances, flow topologies, and signatures of multifractality.

### Diffusiophoresis of a non-polar fluid droplet laden with soluble ionic surfactants

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We investigate the diffusiophoresis of a non-polarizable droplet laden with soluble ionic surfactant, for which the surface charge arises from adsorption of surfactant at the fluid-fluid interface. Unlike previous studies that assume either a fixed surface charge or instantaneous equilibrium between the interface and the adjacent electrolyte, we formulate the interfacial transport based on the mass-balance framework incorporating Langmuir adsorption-desorption kinetics and finite surface diffusivity. The coupled electrokinetic problem is solved using a perturbation approach. Analytical expressions for the droplet mobility and interfacial velocity are derived for insoluble surfactants. We demonstrate that assuming uniform, immobile surface charge leads to unphysical predictions, including negative chemiphoresis and singular mobility, whereas allowing the surface charge to evolve through interfacial surfactant redistribution yields continuous and physically consistent droplet diffusiophoresis. Interfacial kinetic exchange is found to play a central role. Increasing the desorption rate enhances surfactant redistribution and Marangoni stress, weakens the negative mobility, reverses the direction of motion through competition between electrophoretic and chemiphoretic contributions, and subsequently leads to a strong enhancement of positive mobility before eventual saturation in the transport-limited regime. The dependence of mobility on viscosity ratio and electrolyte composition of different salts further reveals how mixed electrolytes provides a robust means of tuning droplet motion. This study highlights the critical role of finite-rate surfactant dynamics and interfacial transport in determining the diffusiophoresis of fluid particles, with implications for manipulating droplets in microfluidic and varying-salinity environments.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<p>by Shuhei Tsuji</p>  The aim of this study was to evaluate the dosimetric characteristics of an IRAsource brachytherapy source using Monte Carlo simulations incorporating source electron effects. The dose rate constant, radial dose function, and two-dimensional (2D) anisotropy function were calculated and compared with those of published data and results of the mHDR-v2r source model. The dose rate constant obtained for the IRAsource was (1.1142±0.0030) cGyh−1U−1, which was consistent with previously reported values, within the range of experimental uncertainty. The radial dose function exhibited a pattern similar to that of the mHDR-v2r source, with dose distributions converging at distances of approximately 10 cm, where the effect of capsule thickness became negligible. The 2D anisotropy function did not fully align with other experimental datasets for the IRAsource. Even when comparing the IRAsource with mHDR-v2r sources, the 2D anithotropy function showed a difference of 3% to 6% around 0 degrees at distances of 0.25 cm to 5.0 cm from the source. The results reflected reasonable trends that were consistent with differences in source capsule geometry of the IRAsource and the mHDR-v2r. These findings show that the dosimetric data presented here is reliable. This study provides essential baseline data for accurate dose assessment of the IRAsource in brachytherapy and underscores the importance of further experimental validation to refine dose characterization.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The self-assembly of polymer grafted nanoparticles is more and more used in the field of functional materials. However, there is still a lack of analysis on the dynamic transformation paths of different self-assembly morphologies, which makes it impossible to achieve further precise regulation and targeted design in experiments and industrial production. In this work the effects of patchy property, grafted chain length, ratio and grafting density on the self-assembly behavior and structure of polymer grafted flexible patchy nanoparticles are investigated by dissipative particle dynamics simulation method through the construction of coarse-grained model of polymer grafted ternary nanoparticles. The influence and regulation mechanisms of these factors on the self-assembly structure transformation of flexible patchy nanoparticles are systematically studied, and a variety of structures such as dendritic structure, columnar structure, and bilayer membrane are obtained. The self-assembly structure of flexible patchy nanoparticles obtained in this work (such as bilayer membrane structure) provides a potential application basis for designing drug carriers. By precisely regulating the specific structural characteristics of the system, it is possible to achieve efficient loading of drugs and targeted delivery functions, thus significantly improving the bioavailability and effect of drugs.

### Carbon–phosphorus exchange rate constrains density–speed trade-off in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal growth

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Symbiotic nutrient exchange between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and their host plants varies widely depending on their physical, chemical, and biological environment. Yet dissecting this context dependency remains challenging because we lack methods for tracking nutrients such as carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). Here, we developed an approach to quantitatively estimate C and P fluxes in the AM symbiosis from comprehensive network morphology quantification, achieved by robotic imaging and machine learning based on roughly 100 million hyphal shape measurements. We found that rates of C transfer from the plant and P transfer from the fungus were, on average, related proportionally to one another. This ratio was nearly invariant across AM fungal strains despite contrasting growth phenotypes but was strongly affected by plant host genotype. Fungal phenotype distributions were bounded by a Pareto front with a shape favoring specialization in an exploration–exploitation trade-off. This means AM fungi can be fast range expanders or fast resource extractors, but not both. Manipulating the C/P exchange rate by swapping the plant host genotype shifted this Pareto front, indicating that the exchange rate constrains possible AM fungal growth strategies. We show by mathematical modeling how AM fungal growth at fixed exchange rate leads to qualitatively different symbiotic outcomes depending on fungal traits and nutrient availability.

### Hierarchical friction memory leads to subdiffusive configurational dynamics of fast-folding proteins

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Proteins often exhibit subdiffusive configurational dynamics, the origins of which are still unresolved. We investigate the impact of non-Markovian friction and the free-energy landscape on the dynamics of fast-folding proteins in terms of the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the mean first-passage-time (MFPT) of the folding reaction coordinate. We find the friction memory kernel from published molecular dynamics simulations to be well-described by a hierarchical multiexponential function, which gives rise to subdiffusion in the MSD for times shorter than the longest memory time, while for longer times the confining free-energy landscape produces subdiffusion. Thus, for a wide range of times, friction memory effects in fast-folding proteins dominate the scaling behavior of the MSD compared to effects due to the folding free-energy landscape. As a consequence, Markovian models are insufficient to fully capture the folding dynamics, as quantified by the MSD and the MFPT, even when including coordinate-dependent friction. Our results demonstrate the importance of memory effects in protein folding and conformational dynamics and explicitly show that subdiffusion in fast-folding protein dynamics originates mainly from memory effects, not from the free-energy landscape and not from coordinate-dependent friction.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Direct fs-laser (1030~nm/200~fs) write of a throughout oxide Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$ on a 200~nm Ta film was achieved using a combined ps- and ns- burst mode (Burst-in-Burst or BiB) of fs-pulse exposure at a high 0.6~MHz repetition rate. Few micrometers-wide lines were formed at the center of 12~$μ$m focal spot by controlled oxidation without ablation. The oxidized regions were flat and optically transparent. Wavelength-scale self-organized ripples of oxidized Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$ sub-1~$μ$m gratings were recorded by rastering a $1\times 1$~mm$^2$ area. The oxidized ripples with periodic pattern $\sim wavelength$ were aligned with the polarization of the writing beam. Energy deposition in the burst-mode oxidation is discussed by comparing 200~fs and 20~ps BiB-mode writing modes. The presented strategy of self-guided oxidation with heat deposition by BiB fs-laser opens an opportunity for debris-free and annealing-free oxidation on a sub-wavelength scale.

### Interfacial dynamics induced by impacts across rigid and soft substrates

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We investigate impact-induced gas-liquid interfacial dynamics through experiments in which a liquid-filled container impacts substrates with elastic moduli from $O(10^{-1})$ MPa to $O(10^{5})$ MPa. Upon impact, the concave gas-liquid interface inside the container deforms and emits a focused jet. When the jet velocity is normalized by the container impact velocity, all data collapse onto a single curve when plotted against the Cauchy number, $Ca = ρ_{\rm e} V_{\rm i}^2 / E$, which represents the ratio of the inertial force of the container-liquid system to the elastic restoring force of the substrate. The dimensionless jet velocity remains nearly constant for $Ca< 10^{-4}$, but decreases significantly for $Ca > 10^{-4}$. Based on this observation, we define the boundary between the rigid-impact and soft-impact regimes using the Cauchy number, providing a quantitative criterion for what constitutes ``softness'' in impact-driven interfacial flows. To explain the reduction in jet velocity observed in the soft-impact regime, we introduce a framework in which only the impulse transferred within the effective time window for jet formation contributes to interface acceleration. This concept, referred to as the partial impulse, captures the situation where the impact interval (the duration of contact between the container and the substrate) exceeds the focusing interval (the time required for jet formation). By modelling the contact force using an elastic foundation model and solving the resulting momentum equation over the finite impulse window, we quantitatively reproduce the experimental results. This partial impulse framework unifies the dynamics of impact-driven jetting across both rigid and soft substrate regimes, extending the applicability of classical impulse-based models.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
An information particle can acquire active-like motion through transforming the information entropy into effective self-propulsion velocity/force using the attached information engine. We consider an underdamped Brownian particle additionally driven by either a constant self-propulsion force or an information engine using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) bath feedback control, such particles are called self-propelled particle (SPP) or OU information particle (OUIP). Compared to the widely-investigated SPP, the OUIP shows a significant different dynamical pattern, including two types of moving mode: a slow-speed diffusion mode and a high-speed traveling mode. The specific evolution of OUIP can be adjusted flexibly between such two modes through the inertial effect, thus acquiring a rich and non-trivial motion behavior. By tuning the strength of fluctuation of the OU bath, a wide range of net velocity can be achieved for OUIP. We highlight that OUIP could be an exceptional candidate for active agent.

Homologous proteins have similar three-dimensional structures and biological functions that shape their sequences. The resulting coevolution-driven correlations underlie methods from Potts models to AlphaFold, which infer protein structure and function from sequences. Using a minimal model, we show that fluctuating selection strength and the onset of new selection pressures improve coevolution-based inference of structural contacts. Our conclusions extend to realistic synthetic data and to the inference of interaction partners. Out-of-equilibrium noise arising from ubiquitous variations in natural selection thus enhances, rather than hinders, the success of inference from protein sequences.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Cellular biomolecular condensates function far from equilibrium, sustained by continuous influx and efflux of molecular components. Notable examples include the nucleolus, nuclear pore complex, P-bodies, and stress granules, in which regulated molecular transport is essential for their function. Experimental characterization of molecular flux remains challenging due to limitations in spatiotemporal resolution, making computational approaches a powerful alternative for systematic investigation. Here, we present a computational approach (TRACE) to model molecular transport through biomolecular condensates under non-equilibrium steady-state conditions at near-atomistic resolution. Using TRACE, we systematically probe physicochemical factors that govern molecular flux through condensates. We find that protein sequence composition and patterning determine the internal structure of the condensates, which strongly influences molecular transport efficiency. Our work also suggests that molecular flux through condensates exhibits reptation dynamics. Moreover, interactions between fluxing molecules and condensates play a critical role in regulating transport. In particular, associative interactions enable a 'handoff mechanism', in which successive transient interactions facilitate directed transport through condensates. Together, these results help advance our understanding on how molecular flux is regulated in biomolecular condensates and provide a basis for rationally tuning condensate-mediated molecular flux, with potential applications in therapeutics and active soft material design.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have yielded important insights into ion conduction in potassium channels, but quantitative comparison with electrophysiological experiments remains challenging. Due to their high computational cost, MD simulations are typically performed at membrane potentials well above physiological values, and at only a limited number of voltages. Since current-voltage relationships are not necessarily linear, this limits direct comparison between simulations and experiments. Here, we introduce a method to estimate the current-voltage characteristics of ion channels from Markov state models (MSMs) constructed from MD simulations performed at only a few membrane potentials. Time-discrete MSMs of ion conduction are converted into continuous-time rate matrices, whose voltage dependence is modelled using a rate theory formulation with free energy barriers depending on membrane potential. This approach enables the prediction of channel currents over a wide voltage range without additional simulations. We validated the method using MD simulations of the potassium channels KcsA and MthK. In both cases, the currents predicted at low membrane potentials are in good agreement with those obtained directly from MD simulations, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the approach.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Background: Gene expression profiling in radiation-exposed blood is a valuable tool for biodosimetry and clinical research. Evaluating the blood's transcriptomic radiation response provides insight into absorbed dose, hematotoxicities, and immune reactions. However, detailed analysis using long-read RNA sequencing is currently limited in its diffusion, despite the potential additional insights that could be extracted, including novel isoform discovery and on-the-field gene expression studies, owing to its portability. Results: In this study, we utilized Oxford Nanopore Technologies' long-read RNA sequencing on human whole-blood samples from three healthy donors 6 hours after exposure to 4 Gy of X-rays. Compared to sham-irradiated (0 Gy) blood, gene-level differential expression analysis identified 117 upregulated and 66 downregulated genes, including canonical DNA damage repair and inflammatory responses. At the transcript level, 102 transcripts were significantly upregulated, and 17 were downregulated, revealing isoform-specific regulation that was not captured at the gene level. Notably, IL32, which showed no significant change at the gene level, exhibited strong upregulation of two transcript isoforms, while WDR74, ITM2B, AK2, and RPS19 displayed changes in transcript usage following irradiation. Leveraging the power of long-read RNA sequencing, we further identified 26 novel transcript isoforms, expanding the catalog of radiation-responsive transcripts. Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive study of long-read RNA-seq for transcriptomic profiling of human whole blood following ionizing radiation. These findings highlight the ability of long-read RNA sequencing to provide a more detailed view of radiation-induced transcriptomic alterations, underscoring its potential for biodosimetry and clinical applications.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins are critical epigenetic readers involved in various diseases, making them attractive therapeutic targets. This study elucidates the molecular basis of inhibition by four clinical-stage BET inhibitors (ZEN-3694, INCB054329, PLX51107, and INCB057643) through detailed structural comparison and analysis. Using X-ray crystallography, we determined their complex structures with the second bromodomain of human BRD2 at 1.4-1.5 Angstrom resolution. All inhibitors occupy the conserved acetyl-lysine binding pocket via extensive hydrophobic interactions. This hydrophobic network is further coupled with hydrogen-bond contacts for inhibitor-binding stabilization. A common feature is the formation of at least one hydrogen bond with a conserved residue of N429. Notably, INCB057643 exhibits an enhanced polar network, forming additional hydrogen bonds with residues D377 and N429, which may contribute to its improved pharmacological profile. These structures reveal a shared competitive inhibition mechanism by occluding the acetyl-lysine binding site, providing a rational basis for their transcriptional repression and guiding future inhibitor design.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is a ubiquitous P-type ATPase that restores cytosolic Ca2+ to the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum. SERCA is essential for cardiac Ca2+ cycling and cellular energy metabolism. Several small molecules enhance SERCA function and show promise in models of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. However, the structural basis for SERCA activation has remained unknown, hindering mechanism-driven lead optimization. Here we present cryo-EM structures of SERCA bound to two chemically distinct activators: the quinoline derivative CDN1163 (2.6 [A] resolution) and a benzofuran derivative UM-52 (3.1 [A] resolution). Biochemical assays show that both compounds stimulate Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of SERCA without altering the apparent Ca2+ affinity. The structures reveal a previously unrecognized activation hotspot in the transmembrane domain, a shallow groove formed by helices M3 and M4 and capped by M1. Despite low chemical similarity, both activators occupy the same pocket and share conserved interactions with Ser265, Trp272, and Phe296. These residues are unique to SERCA and help explain selectivity relative to other P-type ATPases. Activator binding stabilizes a catalytically competent conformation, shifting SERCA toward an E1-like state poised for ATP binding and coordinated movements of the M1-M4 bundle and the cytosolic domains. Notably, density consistent with a detergent acyl chain bridges an otherwise open cavity adjacent to the compound, suggesting that altered protein-lipid interactions may contribute to activation. Together, these findings define a structural framework for SERCA activation and provide a blueprint for rational design of next-generation SERCA activators.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Efficient siRNA delivery by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) is widely attributed to carrier composition, yet how intraparticle packing governs function remains unclear. Here, we developed a single-particle fluorescence microscopy assay that simultaneously quantifies size and siRNA loading of individual, chromophore-labeled LNPs. Imaging ~0.5M particles per hour uncovered two major packing modes: a high and a low order corroborated by cryo-EM. Quantitative live cell imaging on destabilized eGFP reporter cell line combined with systematic variation of LNPs lipid composition and N/P ratio allowed deconvolution of the interplay between siRNA packing, cell internalization and silencing and its dependance on lipid composition and electrostatics. Our findings surprisingly revealed that low-order particles while encapsulating modest RNA, they mediate more efficient knockdown of the destabilized eGFP reporter than their high-order counterparts. Guided by these findings we predicted and experimentally validated that tuning composition and N/P ratio to favor less compact siRNA packing enhances silencing potency. This framework offers actionable guiding for the rational optimization of LNP formulations for RNA therapeutics.

### Modeling IK1 current modulation by melatonin and luzindole: a benchmark for patch clamp studies

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Whole-cell patch-clamp studies often fail to observe the expected effect of melatonin on the IK1 current in cardiomyocytes, which may be due to cytoplasmic dialysis and the loss of key components of the intracellular signaling system. The aim of this study was to develop a simple theoretical model to estimate the expected effect on the IK1 inward-rectifying potassium current in an experiment with intact melatonin signaling. The modeling was performed using a well-established model of rat cardiomyocyte electrophysiology (Pandit et al., 2001). The maximum conductance of IK1 (gK1) channels was chosen as the target for modulation, consistent with the established mechanism of direct receptor-mediated increase in potassium conductance under the action of melatonin.Realistic modulation values were used for the modeling. The -50% value for the antagonist effect of 1 M luzindole was obtained by direct calculation from our experimental data. The +20% value for the agonist effect (melatonin) was determined by generalizing literature data and reflects the typical expected strength of signaling pathway modulation, rather than being strictly tied to a specific concentration.It was shown that modulation of gK1 in the specified ranges leads to significant changes in IK1 amplitude in the physiologically important range of resting potentials. The developed model serves as a "computational benchmark" for validating experimental protocols, allowing one to distinguish methodological artifacts from a true lack of effect.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Somatic homolog pairing is a defining feature of the diploid genome organization in Drosophila and underlies its transvection-based gene regulation. Here, to understand the physical effect of homolog pairing on the resulting three-dimensional (3D) organization, we employ the heterogeneous loop model and reconstruct 3D structures of the Drosophila embryo genome based on its haplotype-resolved Hi-C data. The resulting structures reveal robust end-to-end juxtaposition between homologous chromosomes amid substantial cell-to-cell variability. On sub-megabase scales, tight pairing between homologous loci at domain boundaries give rise to significant coincidence between cis and trans-homolog domain boundaries in the Hi-C map, while interior regions remain loosely associated. To uncover the physical origin of this organization, we compare the contact maps resulting from the polymer models implementing specific and non-specific button-mediated pairing mechanisms with Hi-C, finding that the intra-chromosomal contacts constrained by specifically paired inter-chromosomal buttons give rise to pairing-induced domains (PIDs). Our study suggests specific adhesive interactions as a central organizing principle of the diploid genome in Drosophila embryos.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
This study investigates the complex molecular dynamics of discotic liquid crystals (DLCs) by comparing two structurally similar compounds: Hexakis(hepta-alkanoyloxy)triphenylene (HOT6) and Hexakis(hexa-alkyloxy)triphenylene (HAT6) having the same triphenyl core and the same length of the alkyl side chain. The difference of both materials is that the alkyl chain is linked by an oxygen bridge to the triphenylene core for HAT6 and by a ester group for HOT6. Using a combination of broadband dielectric spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray scattering, and neutron scattering techniques, the research explores the glass transition phenomena and relaxation processes in these materials. HOT6, featuring ester linkages, exhibits distinct dynamic behavior compared to HAT6, including two separate glass transitions indicated by the α1- and α2-relaxation found by dielectric spectroscopy which are assigned to the glassy dynamics of the alkyl side chain in the intercolumnar space and that of the columns, respectively. The study reveals that the ester group in HOT6 leads to increased molecular rigidity and altered packing in the intercolumnar space, as evidenced by X-ray scattering and the vibrational density of states. Neutron scattering confirms localized methyl group rotations and a further relaxation process which relates to the γ-relaxation revealed by dielectric spectroscopy. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of glassy dynamics in partially ordered systems and highlight the influence of molecular architecture on relaxation behavior in DLCs.

Light-gated ion channels (channelrhodopsins; ChR) can be used to precisely control the electrical activity of genetically targeted cell populations with light. While non-selective cation ChR are widely used to elicit action potentials (AP) in excitable cells, the recently identified class of K+-selective ChR (KCR) are promising tools for optogenetic AP inhibition. One of the most K+-selective KCR identified to date is Wobblia lunata inhibitory ChR (WiChR), which — by combining high light sensitivity and prolonged channel opening with efficient expression in neurons and cardiomyocytes — enables reliable suppression of AP firing in response to blue light pulses.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Fungi exhibit remarkable morphological plasticity, which allows them to undergo reversible transitions between distinct cellular states in response to changes in their environment. This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis in a cAMP-independent manner and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i>, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a <i>C. albicans</i> mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 (Pfk1), exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Overall, our work elucidates a previously uncharacterized coupling between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism that is critical for driving fungal morphogenesis, contributing to our understanding of this conserved phenomenon.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is essential for mitochondrial genome maintenance. It binds to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and determines the abundance, packaging, and stability of the mitochondrial genome. Because its function is tightly associated with mtDNA, TFAM has a protective role in mitochondrial diseases, and supportive studies demonstrate reversal of disease phenotypes by TFAM overexpression. In addition, TFAM deficiency has been shown to cause release of mtDNA into the cytosol and activation of the cGAS/STING innate immune response pathway. As such, TFAM presents as a unique target for therapeutic intervention, but limited efforts for activators have been reported. Herein, we disclose novel TFAM small-molecule modulators with sub-micromolar activity. Our results demonstrate that these compounds result in an increase of TFAM protein levels and mtDNA copy number. This results in inhibition of a mtDNA stress-mediated inflammatory response by preventing mtDNA escape into the cytosol. Furthermore, we see beneficial effects in cellular disease models in which boosting TFAM activity has been advanced as a disease-modifying strategy including improved energetics in MELAS cybrid cells and a decrease of fibrotic markers in systemic sclerosis fibroblasts. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of using small-molecule TFAM activators in indications characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction.

### Elastoplastic Modelling of Cyclic Shear Deformation of Amorphous Solids

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We develop an energy-landscape based elasto-plastic model to understand the behaviour of amorphous solids under uniform and cyclic shear. Amorphous solids are modeled as being composed of mesoscopic sub-volumes, each of which may occupy states - termed mesostates -- drawn from a specified distribution. The energies of the mesostates under stress free conditions determine their stability range with respect to applied strain, and their plastic strain, at which they are stress free, forms an important additional property. Under applied global strain, mesostates that reach their stability limits transition to other permissible mesostates. Barring such transitions, which encompass plastic deformations that the solid may undergo, mesostates are treated as exhibiting linear elastic behavior, and the interactions between mesoscopic blocks are treated using the finite element method. The model reproduces known phenomena under uniform and cyclic shear, such as the brittle-to-ductile crossover with annealing and the Bauschinger effect for uniform shear, qualitative features of the yielding diagram under cyclic shear including the change in yielding behaviour with the degree of annealing, across a `threshold level', and dynamic phenomena such as the divergence of failure times on approach to the yield point and the non-monotonic evolution of the local yield rate. In addition to these results, we discuss the dependence of the observed behaviour on model choices, and open questions highlighted by our work.

### Broadening the temperature range of blue phases using $azo$ compounds of various molecular geometries assembled from modular "LEGO" molecular units

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The temperature range of the blue phases (BPs) formed in highly chiral mixtures based on cholesteryl oleyl carbonate (COC) and the nematic liquid crystal E7 was studied in the presence of various chemical structures. The $azo$ compounds used were of both chiral and achiral nature, and their molecular geometry was modified by substitution of modular "LEGO" molecular units of varying alkyl chain lengths and types of bridging groups, which could substantially affect the mesomorphic properties of the matrix mixture. It was shown that in many cases these dopants effectively broadened the BP temperature range. This effect depends on both the variation in the molecular geometry of the $azo$ compounds and the increase in the $cis$-isomer concentration under UV irradiation. The presence of the $cis$-isomers formed have a stronger impact on broadening the BP temperature range than the initial $trans$-isomers. These results demonstrate that the temperature range of BPs can be precisely controlled via a combination of molecular engineering and $trans$-$cis$ photo-isomerization.

### Geometry and dynamical morphology of growing bacterial colonies

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We study non-equilibrium bacterial colony growth using a geometry-first, time-resolved analysis of morphology. From time-lapse microscopy data, we track the coupled evolution of area, perimeter, and boundary-sensitive shape descriptors along the full growth history. We find that non-equilibrium growth can exhibit extended intervals of compact area--perimeter scaling with exponent $α\approx 2$, consistent with growth governed by a single effective geometric length scale, as well as time-localized breakdowns of this scaling during ongoing growth. These breakdowns coincide with transient boundary reorganization while bulk area growth remains sustained. Our results demonstrate that visually distinct morphologies can arise within the same geometric growth regime, and that departures from single-scale behavior reflect intrinsic dynamical restructuring rather than growth arrest. More broadly, this work establishes time-resolved geometry as a coarse-grained framework for identifying when non-equilibrium growth departs from single-scale geometric constraints in living systems.

### Vortex formation in the Vicsek model with internal chirality of self-propelling objects

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Effect of internal chirality on collective motion of large number of active objects is studied by simulations of appropriately modified Vicsek model. We add a fixed angle to the noise and consider small ratios, p,   between this angle and the maximal deviation from the average local direction of motion.   When the above ratio is p=1/120, the traveling bands observed with the symmetrical noise are   destroyed, and small bands moving in different directions   appear. Circular rotating flocks of objects with the same orientation are formed for p=1/7.5. Stable vortexes in the stationary state were found from p=1/60   to p=1/20. Velocity autocorrelation function shows equilibrium between the inflow and the outflow to and from the vortex. Long-time evolution is significantly influenced by a temporary trapping of the objects in the vortex. The ballistic behavior for the symmetrical noise changes to the diffusive   behavior for the chirality leading to the onset of vortexes.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The mechanisms of flow in suspensions of soft particles above the glass-transition volume fraction and in the jammed state were probed using Orthogonal Superposition Rheometry (OSR). A small amplitude oscillatory shear flow is superimposed orthogonally onto a steady shear flow, which allows monitoring the viscoelastic spectra of sheared jammed core-shell microgels during flow. The characteristic crossover frequency ωc, deduced from the viscoelastic spectrum, provides information about the shear induced structural relaxation time, which is connected to the microscopic yielding mechanism of cage breaking. The shear rate evolution of the crossover frequency is used to achieve a superposition of all spectra and get a better insight of the flow mechanism. Despite their inherent softness, the hybrid core-shell microgels exhibit similarities with hard sphere-like flow behavior, with the main difference that for the microgels the transition from a glassy to a jammed state introduces a volume fraction dependence of the scaling of ωc with shear rate. We further check the application of the Kramers-Kronig relations on the experimental low strain amplitude OSR data finding a good agreement. Finally, the low frequency response at high strain rates was investigated with open bottom cell geometry and instrumental limits were identified. Based on these limits, we discuss previous OSR data and findings in repulsive and attractive colloidal glasses, and compared them with the current soft particle gels.

### Boundary compliance selects heterogeneous dynamics in shear-thickening suspensions

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The mechanical properties of confining boundaries can fundamentally alter the flow behaviour of shear-thickening suspensions. We study a dense cornstarch suspension sheared beneath a viscous silicone-oil layer, using the oil viscosity to tune boundary compliance. Flow visualisation and rheometry reveal two distinct regimes. With compliant boundaries, long-lived heterogeneities emerge via density waves or persistent clusters, maintained by a balance between interface deformation and particle rearrangement. With more resistant confinement, we observe transient jamming events, marked by abrupt spanning of load-bearing structures across the suspension thickness and the emergence of secondary stress waves. The onset stress of these events remains constant at the DST threshold, independent of bounding viscosity. Our results reveal that boundary compliance selects the lifetime and morphology of heterogeneous structures, offering a means to amplify otherwise short-lived microscopic processes and providing new insight into the interplay between shear thickening, shear jamming, and confinement mechanics.

### Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The critical incompatibility of polymers with different compositions scales inversely with their length. For instance, a mixture of A and B homopolymers of length $N$ segregates at $χ_{AB}^{cr} = 2/N$. But what if the difference between the blend components is subtler? We demonstrate that a mixture of AB copolymers with identical composition -- equal amounts of A and B monomers -- but different primary sequences can still phase separate. Incompatibility arises from distinct positional correlations between monomers of different chains. Calculating the Gaussian fluctuation correction to the free energy reveals that critical incompatibility from sequence differences follows a distinct yet universal scaling with chain length, $χ_{AB}^{cr} \sim 1 / \sqrt{N}$. This power law holds for both regular-sequence and statistical copolymers. A closed-form expression is derived for blends of block-alternating chains. The new theoretical scaling is confirmed by coarse-grained simulations, offering important insights into multiphase coexistence in biomolecular condensates.

An active dissipative process organizes auditory frequency analysis in the mammalian cochlea. A minimal active beam model reveals that a spatially varying viscous coupling operator, $\partial_{xx}κ\partial_{xx}$, generates dissipative forces with wave--like propagation. Local energy injection and spatial redistribution compete to govern the dynamics. This balance enables the quantitative reproduction of four key features: sharp tuning, high gain, compression, and spontaneous otoacoustic emissions.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Weakly coupled oscillators adjust their dynamics to work in unison: they synchronize. This ubiquitous phenomenon is observed for oscillating pendulum, electronic devices, as well as clapping crowds or flashing fireflies. In effect, synchronization constitutes an efficient mean to translate microscopic into large scale dynamics. While broadly studied theoretically, experimental investigations of synchronization of systems at the microscale are limited. Here we devise and study a model system of noisy and "measurably imperfect" colloidal oscillators: autonomous clocks made of an active swimmer revolving around a passive sphere. The distribution of natural frequency of the clock is achieved using passive spheres of various sizes, thus without altering the (phoretic) coupling between clocks. We observe that pairs of oscillators lock phases before slipping and returning to sync, and we characterize the synchronicity of the pair. We rationalize our findings with a stochastic model, formalizing synchronization as a classical Kramers escape problem in an adequate potential. This provides an analytical expression for the rate of synchronization of a pair set by the ratio between differences of natural frequency and environmental noise, and agrees qualitatively with the experiment. Our results set a blueprint for synchronization with micrometric autonomous systems.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Cell cycle progression requires cells to continually remodel their gene expression programs as they transition through distinct functional states. Although transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms have long dominated our understanding of this regulation, recent work additionally highlights the essential contribution of cell cycle-specific mRNA decay and translational control. Across G1, S, G2, and mitosis, cells dynamically modulate global and transcript-specific mRNA stability and translation to coordinate processes including DNA replication, growth, checkpoint signaling, and chromosome segregation. Mitosis presents a particularly striking challenge: transcription is silenced, necessitating that cells rely on post-transcriptional mechanisms to sustain mitotic functions and preserve viability. In this review, we highlight how these coordinated layers of post-transcriptional regulation collectively contribute to cell cycle control.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Faithful chromosome segregation during bacterial replication requires global reorganization of the nucleoid, where Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes play a crucial role. Here we develop an energy-landscape framework that integrates data-driven pairwise interactions with coarse-grained polymer physics to infer the 3D architectural ensembles of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis chromosomes throughout replication. We show that SMC-mediated long-range lengthwise compaction reshapes the nucleoid to induce a robust mid-replication transition in which the terminus relocates toward the nucleoid center and duplicated origins segregate toward opposite cell halves. SMC-deficient mutants lack this transition and instead exhibit emergent nematic-like alignment of sister chromosomes that impedes segregation. A distinctive inter-sister Hi-C signature accompanies the emergence of the nematic alignment. By systematically tuning nonspecific inter-sister adhesion, we reveal that SMC activity expands the physical regime permitting faithful segregation. This buffering protects segregation against adhesive forces intrinsic to the crowded bacterial nucleoid. Our framework provides mechanistic insight into SMC-dependent co-replication segregation across bacterial species, yielding experimentally testable predictions for imaging and sister-chromosome-resolved Hi-C.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The impact of single amino acid substitution on T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition is central to understanding the molecular determinants of TCR specificity and degeneracy during viral mutational escape, cancer recognition, and autoimmunity. In this study, we developed a biophysics-informed computational approach integrating experimental alanine-scan mutagenesis data from the autoimmune-associated ALWGPDPAAA peptide bound to HLA-A*02:01 together with coarse-grained structural modeling. Our approach reconstructs the energetics and structural determinants underpinning the observed loss of recognition by the diabetogenic 1E6 TCR upon single-point mutations, specifically at the critical Pro5 and Asp6 residues. Leveraging the computational models ability to incorporate multiple structural templates into binding predictions, this approach quantitatively reproduces experimentally measured affinity disruptions. Additionally, we apply our approach to identify potential compensatory interactions capable of restoring binding affinity through alternative residue interactions. This integrative computational framework contributes a strategy for inferring TCR-peptide binding energetics at the single amino acid level, guiding the rational design of peptide-based immunotherapeutics, and predicting the functional impacts of clinically relevant peptide variants.

### Adenocarcinoma cell mechanobiology is altered by the loss modulus of the surrounding extracellular matrix

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Elastic and viscoelastic properties of extracellular matrices (ECM) are known to regulate cellular behavior and mechanosensation differently, with implications for morphogenesis, wound healing, and pathophysiology. Most in vitro cellular processes, including cell migration, are studied on linear-elastic substrates to mimic extracellular matrices. However, tissues are actually viscoelastic and display a loss modulus (G) that may be 10-20% of their storage modulus (G). Recent research has shown that cells can distinguish between elastic and viscoelastic ECM, leading to alterations in their cellular morphology, migration rates, and contractility. Here, we present a protocol for creating PAH-based model ECMs that enables the fabrication of viscoelastic substrates with storage moduli similar to those of their elastic counterparts. To explore how G influences epithelial cell mechanobiology, we fabricated tunable viscoelastic model ECMs with G of 3 kPa, 8 kPa, and 12 kPa, and for each, independently tuned G values to approximately 300 Pa, 500 Pa, and 700 Pa, respectively. We found that A549 cells cultured on stiff elastic model ECMs migrated [~]30% slower and formed larger focal adhesions compared to their viscoelastic counterparts. Conversely, A549 cells on intermediate viscoelastic model ECMs exhibited a [~]54% reduction in migration speed, with no significant difference in focal adhesion size relative to their elastic counterparts. These findings highlight the complex interplay between substrate (ECM) elastic and viscoelastic properties in regulating epithelial cell mechanobiology and emphasize the importance of time-dependent matrix mechanics in governing epithelial responses.

### Active Site Local Environment Allows Acidic and Basic Synergy in Enzymatic Ester Hydrolysis by PETase

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a commonly used plastic worldwide and reducing its prevalence is crucial to improving environmental pollution. PETase that degrades PET plastic have received a lot of attention recently. This paper evaluates the ester hydrolysis process under both acidic and basic conditions, and shows that the local environment of the protein active site takes advantage of both. High pH in the protein buffer creates a better nucleophile to attack the ester through a proton shuttle channel in the protein, while local hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl of the ester stabilizes the intermediate/transition state of the hydrolysis reaction. With the understanding at the atomic level, we propose two engineering directions that can potentially improve the reactivity of the PETase: 1) increase the alkaline stability of the protein in general; 2) perturb the local hydrogen bond network to increase the partial charge on the PET carbonyl to be hydrolyzed.

### On the Use of Double Mutant Cycles to Probe the Molecular Interactions in Biomolecular Condensates

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Disordered proteins can form biomolecular condensates by demixing from their environment, enabling reversible compartmentalisation of cellular components in the form of membraneless organelles. Multivalent interactions are essential for this type of phase separation behaviour, and for disordered proteins, the potential for multivalent interactions is encoded in the sequence composition and patterning. Mutational studies have been instrumental in helping elucidate this sequence grammar by perturbing the amino acid sequence and quantifying the resulting changes in the driving force for phase separation. While such studies have provided a detailed and predictive understanding of the driving forces for phase separation, they strictly do not inform on the nature of the interactions that drive phase separation. Here, we propose using double mutant cycles to explore molecular interactions and their contributions to condensate properties more directly. We explore the applicability of double mutant cycles for different types of interactions in condensates formed by the low-complexity domain of hnRNPA1 using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the interactions between arginine and tyrosine residues, as well as between aromatic residues, contribute mostly additively to the propensity for phase separation. However, for the interactions between charged residues, we find that--in an interplay with the net charge of the protein--there is a measurable non-additive contribution to the phase separation propensity. Based on our results, we envisage that double mutant cycles could provide additional insights into protein phase separation, thus expanding the understanding of the sequence grammar and the underlying molecular interactions.

### Gangliosides GM3 And GD3 Modulate Insulin Aggregation Pathways and Reduce Cytotoxicity Through Structural Remodeling

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Insulin amyloid aggregation is a key pathological and pharmaceutical concern, particularly in the context of Type-2 Diabetes (T2D), where amyloid deposition of protein can impair therapeutic efficacy and contribute to cell death leading to local tissue damage. Although gangliosides--glycosphingolipids containing sialic acid residues--are known to modulate amyloid formation in neurodegenerative disorders, their influence on insulin aggregation remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the effects of gangliosides GM3 and GD3 on insulin aggregation. Using Thioflavin-T (ThT) based fluorescence kinetics, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), the aggregation pathway, changes in the secondary structure and morphology of insulin aggregates have been characterized. Our results show that both GM3 and GD3 lipids accelerated insulin aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner while steering the pathway away from classical fibril formation, producing short, beaded structures distinct from the extended fibrils observed under lipid-free conditions. CD and FTIR data analyses revealed that insulin in the presence of gangliosides formed non-fibrillar intermediates with distinct secondary structures: {beta}-sheet-rich globular clusters in presence of GD3 and -helical intermediates in GM3-treated samples. Cytotoxicity assays further demonstrated that ganglioside-induced aggregates are significantly less toxic to cells when compared to insulin-only aggregates. Furthermore, ganglioside-bound insulin oligomers retain seeding capacity, suggesting that they can nucleate further aggregation despite their non-fibrillar morphology. These findings underscore the role of gangliosides in modulating insulin amyloid polymorphism and toxicity, offering new insights into their potential impact on the pathology of T2D and treatment strategies.

### Buoyancy-driven sorting of synthetic cells for nanopore activity

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The development of sorting strategies that directly report on functional activity remains a bottleneck in synthetic cell research. Current methodologies typically rely on sequential label-dependent probing, which limits throughput. Here, we introduce a label-free, buoyancy-driven selection strategy in which the mode of separation and the mode of decision-making are intrinsically linked, coupling pore activity directly to the synthetic vesicles internal density in a one-pot assay. In this system, sorting emerges intrinsically: Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) that contain a dense medium sediment by default, while only those with functional transmembrane pores undergo solute exchange, leading to density equilibration and flotation. We exploit this principle to separate pore-active from non-functional GUVs without external markers or imaging-based readouts. Using protein pores and DNA origami and DNA tile nanopores, we demonstrate that buoyancy-driven separation enables parallel functional assessment of heterogeneous populations and supports flow-based enrichment of highly active synthetic cells. By directly linking molecular transport performance to GUV buoyancy, this approach collapses decision-making into the physical separation process itself, providing a scalable platform for screening, sorting, and evolving membrane pores in synthetic cell systems.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
: The pathological hallmark of Parkinson Disease (PD) is the formation of the protein alpha-synuclein (Asyn) into {beta}-sheet rich, self-templating fibrils in the brain. Since the first atomic structure of wild-type Asyn fibrils was determined nearly a decade ago, several other in vitro structures of hereditary mutant fibrils and structures derived from post-mortem diseased patient tissue have been determined by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. These structures have not only expanded the library of structures available for computational modeling of drug binding and therapeutics development but have also given unprecedented insight into the disease specificity and structural polymorphism of Asyn fibrils. Here, we report the high-resolution SSNMR structure of the A30P hereditary mutant Asyn fibril, associated with early-onset PD. Our structural model is calculated using several thousand distance restraints derived from one sample, primarily sourced through 3D 13C-13C-13C correlation experiments. The structure adopts a Greek key topology yet does not include the P30 mutation site within the fibril core. We also introduce a comprehensive method for the rapid comparison of SSNMR spectra between Asyn polymorphs of known structure and validate the A30P fold. Lastly, we find that the structure is highly similar to many other experimental structures of both in vitro and ex vivo Asyn fibrils, including those with other hereditary point mutations, suggesting a conserved accessible fold

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Clinically, palpation is one of the important diagnostic methods to assess tumor malignancy. In laboratory research, it is well accepted that the bulk stiffness of the tumor and the surrounding tissue is closely correlated with the malignant state of the tumor. Here, we postulate that, in addition to tumor stiffness, tumor viscoelasticity – the fact that tumor tissue takes time to bounce back after compression, can also be used to evaluate the tumor malignancy state. In this work, we characterized the viscoelastic properties of tumor spheroids using a recently developed microfluidic compression device by quantifying their relaxation dynamics upon load removal. Tumor spheroids were made using breast tumor cells spanning various malignancy levels; non-tumorigenic epithelial (MCF10A), moderately malignant tumor (MCF7) and triple negative metastatic tumor (MDA-MB-231) cell line. Spheroids embedded within a 3D extracellular matrix were periodically compressed, and their strain responses were recorded using microscopic imaging. Our results revealed that the measured strain relaxation dynamics can be successfully described by a modified power law model, demonstrated that non-tumorigenic tumor spheroids were more elastic, exhibited shorter relaxation time and less plasticity than those of tumorigenic spheroids. This work highlights that viscoelastic properties in addition to bulk stiffness of the tumor spheroids can serve as a complementary mechanical biomarker of tumor malignancy and demonstrate the validity of a modified power law model for the mechanical characterization of a living tissue.

### Effect of charge regulation on the screening properties of zwitterionic macroion solutions

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Precisely controlling the surface charge of zwitterionic macromolecules is crucial for tailoring their properties and optimizing them for specific applications. Here, we present a generalized calculation scheme for determining the screening length in solutions containing zwitterionic macroions, where the charge of the macroion is controlled by the electrolyte solution. This scheme bypasses the need to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation by expressing the inverse screening parameter in terms of the derivative of pressure with respect to chemical potential. The scheme reveals that the screening length has two components: one related to the Debye length with effective charges, and another stemming from the macroion surface dissociation equilibrium, which exhibits a 'screening resonance' behavior. Furthermore, we find that the charge-regulated non-uniform surface charge distribution induced by environment cues strongly affects the screening behavior. The charge regulation properties of macroions, even in dilute solutions, are a key factor in the screening of electrostatic interactions, offering insights into complex biological and nanomaterial systems.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We investigate the behavior of Lumbriculus variegatus in circular and polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and then become dynamically trapped at the concave corners over prolonged periods. We model the worm as a self-propelled rod and derive analytical expressions for the evolution of its orientation when it encounters the flat and the circular boundaries of the chamber. By further incorporating translational and rotational diffusion, arising due to the undulatory and peristaltic body strokes, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that the self-propelled rod model can capture both the boundary aligning and the corner trapping behavior of the worm. The Péclet number Pe, representing the ratio of forward propulsion to rotational diffusion, is found to characterize the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time distribution of the worm. Simulations show that the angle of the worm's body with the boundary while entering a concave corner plays a key role in determining the trapping time, with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion combined with limited angular diffusion can lead to spatial localization that mimics shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms, even in the absence of thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrate considerable potential in medical applications, including targeted drug delivery and diagnostic probes. However, their efficacy depends on their ability to navigate through the complex biological environments inside living organisms. In such environments, NPs interact with a dense mixture of biomolecules, which can reduce their mobility and hinder diffusion. Understanding the factors influencing NP diffusion in these environments is key to improving nanomedicine design and predicting toxicological effects. In this study, we propose a computational approach to model NP diffusion in crowded environments. We introduce a mesoscale model that accounts for the combined effects of the Protein Corona (PC) and the crowded medium on NP mobility. By including volume-exclusion interactions and modelling the PC both explicitly and implicitly, we identify key macromolecular descriptors that affect NP diffusion. Our results show that the morphology of the PC can significantly affect the diffusion of NPs, and the role of the occupied volume fraction and the size ratio between tracers and crowders are analysed. The results also show that approximating large macromolecular assemblies with a hydrodynamic single-sphere model leads to inexact diffusion estimates. To overcome the limitations of single-sphere representations, a strategy for an accurate parameterization of NP-PC systems using a single-sphere model is presented and the validity and limitations of the model are discussed.

Chiral liquid crystals (LCs) are indispensable functional materials for advanced optoelectronic devices. However, their integration with metal-based emitters remains largely unexplored, limiting the understanding of the influence of external electric fields on different photophysical regimes. In this study, we prepared emissive chiral LC materials by doping two achiral platinum(II) complexes-trans-bis(N-isopropyl-5-iminomethyl-1H-pyrazolato)platinum(II) and cis-bis(N-methyl-5iminomethyl-1H-pyrazolato)platinum(II)-into a chiral nematic LC host (N* LC) composed of achiral 4′-pentyl-4biphenylcarbonitrile and chiral 2-octyl-4-[4-(hexyloxy)benzoyloxy]benzoate (2OHBB). Although both platinum complexes are intrinsically achiral luminophores, the resulting N* LC materials exhibited pronounced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Remarkably, these CPL-active chiral LC systems demonstrated continuous and fully reversible modulation of their CPL characteristics upon application or removal of a direct-current (DC) electric field. In addition to the chiral induction originating from 2OHBB, the handedness of CPL emission could be reversibly switched by toggling the DC field (ON-OFF-ON). This behaviour is attributable to a reversible phase transition between distinct ordered helical structures within the chiral nematic phase. By combining organic platinum emitters and N* LC matrices, this work broadens the design space for CPL control and advances the materials science underpinning electrically switchable CPL devices

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Transition metals, such as iron and zinc, are indispensable trace elements for eukaryotic life, acting as co-factors in essential processes ranging from metabolism to DNA replication. These metals can be transported into cells by an evolutionary-conserved family of metal transporters; however, how the ubiquitous mammalian parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> acquires essential metals has been unknown. Here, we have identified and characterised the first iron and zinc importer in <i>T. gondii</i>. This transporter, named ZFT, localised to the parasite plasma membrane and is essential for the parasite’s life cycle. We find ZFT is regulated by iron availability and overexpression sensitises cells to excess iron and zinc. Using a conditional knockdown system, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to reduction in mitochondrial respiration and a switch to a more quiescent lifecycle stage. To confirm transport activity, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to a reduction in parasite-associated zinc and iron, and ZFT expression complements loss of zinc transporter activity in a yeast model. Further, expression of ZFT in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes demonstrates direct uptake of iron, which is outcompeted in the presence of zinc. Overall, we have identified the first metal uptake transporter in <i>T. gondii</i> and demonstrated the importance of iron and zinc to the parasite. This finding advances our understanding of how this obligate intracellular parasite acquires nutrients from its host.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Axolotls (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>) exhibit a remarkable ability to regenerate limbs. Classical experiments have suggested that contact between cells derived from distinct orientations—dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior—within the regenerating blastema is necessary for accurate limb pattern formation. However, the molecular basis for this requirement has remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that both dorsal and ventral tissues are required for limb formation via induction of <i>Shh</i> expression, which plays a crucial role in limb patterning. Using the accessory limb model, we induced position-specific blastemas lacking cells derived from a single orientation (anterior, posterior, dorsal, or ventral). Limb patterning occurred only in blastemas containing both dorsal- and ventral-derived cells. We further observed that <i>Shh</i> expression requires dorsoventral contact within a blastema, highlighting the necessity of dorsoventral contact for inducing <i>Shh</i> expression. Additionally, we identified WNT10B and FGF2 as dorsal- and ventral-mediated signals, respectively, that create the inductive environment for <i>Shh</i> expression. Our findings clarify the role of dorsal and ventral cells in inducing <i>Shh</i>, a mechanism that has rarely been studied in the context of limb regeneration and pattern formation. This model provides new insights into how cells with different positional identities drive the regeneration process.

In contrast, lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) achieves the resolution necessary to resolve such fine structures but, in its open-source implementation, can be alignment- and maintenance-intensive, often requiring specialist expertise. To address this gap, we developed Altair light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), a high-resolution, open-source, sample-scanning light-sheet microscope specifically designed for subcellular imaging. By optimizing the optical pathway in silico, we created a custom baseplate that greatly simplifies alignment and assembly. The system integrates streamlined optoelectronics and optomechanics with seamless operation through our open-source software, <i>navigate</i>. Altair-LSFM achieves lateral and axial resolutions of approximately 235 and 350 nm, respectively, across a 266 µm field of view after deconvolution. We validate the system’s capabilities by imaging sub-diffraction fluorescent nanospheres and visualizing fine structural details in mammalian cells, including microtubules, actin filaments, nuclei, and Golgi apparatus. We further demonstrate its live-cell imaging capabilities by visualizing microtubules and vimentin intermediate filaments in actively migrating cells.

### Sculpting 2D Crystals via Membrane Contractions before and during Solidification

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
When phospholipids crystallize within the otherwise fluid membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles, the resulting molecularly-thin "2D" solids exhibit great variety in their morphology evolution. For instance within membranes containing moderate amounts of the crystallizing component, crystals grow with a fixed morphology depending on vesicle size. Conversely for membranes containing large amounts of the crystallizing species, we find small compact crystals on vesicles of all sizes. However on large vesicles, growing crystals sprout flower petals that lengthen progressively. These behaviors result from two combined mechanisms: First, like other 2D solids, the shear rigidity of phospholipid crystals renders them intolerant to morphologies with non-zero Gaussian curvature. As a result and especially at elevated membrane tension, the cost of bending elasticity is reduced, at the expense of line energy, by the formation of flowers as opposed to compact crystals. Second, the composition-dependent tension rise during cooling relaxes via water permeation of the membrane with a time constant scaling as $R^2$. The amount of crystal formed for a small decrease in temperature determines this composition-dependent increase in stress from thermal contractions versus solidification. Surface Evolver computations motivated using the predicted tension evolution to develop a processing space that maps to experimental observations for initial and growing crystal morphology. Important variable groups are identified, including a scaled ratio of bending to line energy, a vesicle size-independent group for membrane contractions, and a time constant for stress relaxation. Though processing stresses ultimately relax, the crystal morphology persists well beyond the processing window.

### Metastability and ripening of multi-component liquid mixtures

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Understanding how multi-component liquid mixtures undergo phase separation is central to elucidating biophysical organization in the cell. Here, combining analytical and numerical results, we characterise the dynamics of mixtures with disordered interactions among the components. We first study how two coexisting phases become unstable, leading to multiphase coexistence. We then show that the scaling of droplet radius as $t^{1/3}$ and droplet number as $n^{-2/3}$, characteristic of Ostwald ripening in two dimensions, can be severely delayed. This delay arises from glass-like relaxation and the emergence of long-lived metastable states characterized by different wetting angles.

### Constraints on stability and renormalization group flows in nonequilibrium matter

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.

Magnetorheological fluids consist of micrometer-sized magnetic particles in a carrier liquid. Sufficiently strong external magnetic fields lead to the formation of string-like particle aggregates. We demonstrate that hydrodynamic interactions, that is, mutual couplings via induced flows, play a substantial role during structure formation. Hydrodynamics supports the emergence of string-like aggregates, while magnetic interactions align them. This fundamental insight is substantial from an application perspective, due to the enormous technical importance and potential of magnetorheological fluids.

### Transport Properties of Active Particles Moving on Adjustable Networks

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Active adaptive matter has attracted considerable interest due to its rich, largely unexplained dynamics and its relevance to a wide range of synthetic and biological materials. An important subclass of such systems consists of active particles that can remodel the network in which they move. Here, we introduce a minimal yet versatile model of active particles moving on an adjustable network. In this model, particles undergo discrete run-and-tumble motion along the links of a triangular lattice and leave behind a trail of temporarily blocked links. These closed links cannot be traversed by other particles and reopen only after a characteristic healing time. The resulting trail-mediated blocking mechanism is fundamentally distinct from more familiar interactions such as excluded-volume effects. In the high-persistence limit, we find a qualitative contrast between the two mechanisms: while steric blocking leads to reduced diffusivity with increasing persistence, trail-induced blocking causes diffusivity to increase monotonically. We characterize this fundamental difference and the associated, unexpected transport properties, and discuss potential applications of our findings.

### A new molecular tool for detection of the highly invasive gecko, <i>Hemidactylus frenatus</i>

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<p>by Arati Agarwal, Melissa L. Thomas, Yvette Hitchen, Paul Doughty, Simon J. McKirdy, Brendan C. Rodoni, Mark J. Blacket</p>  The Common House Gecko, <i>Hemidactylus frenatus</i>, also known as the Asian House Gecko (AHG), is the most significant invasive gecko globally. Detecting this species can be challenging because it closely resembles other geckos, and is often not directly observed, being cryptic and nocturnal. Traces such as scats, however, are more readily observed than the animal itself. Here, we developed and tested a new diagnostic mitochondrial ND2 LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification) assay to detect and distinguish AHG from other geckos. Testing DNA from twenty-five non-target gecko and skink species present in Western Australia demonstrated the species-specificity of the assay. This new molecular assay showed amplification in under 15 minutes from AHG DNA. Intraspecific variation did not adversely affect the LAMP assay, with all AHG tissue samples successfully amplifying. This included samples from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands territory of Australia which were >6% genetically divergent from mainland Australian samples, representing a genetic group that was previously unknown, referred to here as AHG “clade E”. The assay was found to be highly sensitive, capable of amplifying AHG DNA at very low levels, down to 0.0001 ng/µL of AHG DNA, within 25 minutes. The new LAMP assay has been fully optimised for in-field use, including development and testing of a non-destructive DNA extraction method for in-field extractions from both AHG tissue and scat samples, as well as a gBlock gene fragment for use as a synthetic positive control. The in-field protocols were tested on 100 field collected scats, from multiple lizard species in Western Australia, demonstrating the AHG specificity of the assay, with amplification successful on 79% of AHG scats tested in-field. While the assay was highly effective, scat DNA degradation and inhibitors limited detection in 21% of AHG samples, highlighting preservation challenges. This new assay has already been applied operationally in the field, providing early detection of AHG, and preventing potential introduction of this species into new areas.

### Apical and basolateral plasma membranes in epithelial cells have distinct lipidomes and biophysical properties

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Epithelial cell polarization is essential for many physiological processes, including tissue morphogenesis, nutrient absorption, barrier integrity, and directional secretion. A defining feature of such polarization is the separation of plasma membrane (PM) lipids and proteins into distinct apical and basolateral compartments. It has long been suggested that the apical compartment is rich in glycolipids and cholesterol and that this composition arises through trafficking of self-assembled membrane domains (termed lipid rafts). However, neither the detailed composition nor the mechanisms of molecular sorting between epithelial cell PM compartments have been fully resolved. Particularly, the lipid profile of the basolateral membrane and consequently the lipid disparity between the apical and basolateral membrane remain undefined. We developed a method to separately isolate the apical and basolateral PM and used lipidomics and biophysical profiling to characterize the changes in membrane composition and properties between these compartments in polarized Madin–Darby canine kidney cells. We find that the apical membrane is enriched in cholesterol, saturated lipids, and glycolipids relative to the basolateral membrane and that its biophysical properties reflect a more ordered environment. Further, we evaluate the longstanding hypothesis that lipid rafts contribute to apical protein trafficking by assessing the relationship between transmembrane domain raft affinity and apical localization and find that lipid raft affinity only modestly influences apical versus basolateral sorting. These findings define the distinct compositional and biophysical features of apical and basolateral compartments of epithelial cells and suggest mechanistic evidence for their biogenesis.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Organ injury triggers nonneuronal electric currents essential for regeneration. However, the mechanisms by which electrical signals are generated, sensed, and transmitted upon damage to promote organ growth remain unclear. Here, we uncover that organ repair relies on dynamic electrochemical coupling between membrane potential depolarization and intracellular signaling, essential to activate cell proliferation. By subsecond live imaging of locally injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across time and space: a millisecond, long-range, membrane depolarization gradient, followed by second-persistent intracellular calcium responses. In the subsequent hour, voltage sensing phosphatase senses the injury-driven membrane potential change and autonomously translates the electric signal intracellularly, promoting tissue-wide cell proliferation. Connecting these dynamics with an electrodiffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fin’s interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading. Our work reveals the coupling between fast electrical signals and slower intracellular signaling, ensuring complete organ recovery.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
CRISPR diagnostics have emerged as powerful tools for detecting infectious diseases, with the RNA endonuclease Cas13a enabling sensitive and specific, amplification-free RNA detection through collateral trans-cleavage of fluorescent reporters. However, background cleavage from unbound enzyme, contaminating nucleases, and unsynchronized initiation of reactions limits assay sensitivity and interpretability. A strategy to precisely control the onset of Cas13a catalytic activity, essentially a molecular 'starting gun', would address these challenges and expand assay design space. Here, we introduce Light-Uncaged Cas13a (LUCas), a light controllable system that directly gates Cas13a using a photocleavable interfering guide RNA (pc-igRNA) that suppresses trans-cleavage activity even in the presence of target RNA. Brief UV illumination releases this suppression, restoring full activity. Quantitative kinetic analysis reveals an approximately 100-fold suppression of trans-cleavage activity prior to photo-activation. Importantly, LUCas also suppresses target-independent background activity, enabling a predictive, background-limited determination of assay sensitivity. Using measured kinetic parameters, we predict and experimentally validate the limit-of-detection of the LUCas system. Finally, we demonstrate a multiplexed detection strategy termed 'temporal barcoding,' which enables quantitative detection of viral co-infections in a single bulk reaction. Together, these results establish LUCas as a general framework for mechanistically informed, light-based control of Cas13a activity.

Time resolved X-ray crystallography is experiencing a resurgence, in part, because of serial methods that readily allow scientists to create stop-motion movies of macromolecular function of photoactivation, enzyme catalysed reactions, and ligand-induced conformational changes triggering further downstream signalling events. While some reactions can be initiated with light, either naturally or using photocaged compounds, a more generally applicable approach is to mix microcrystals with reagents at varying time points prior to exposure to the X-ray beam. A powerful approach has been to combine droplet on demand  tape drive sample delivery with X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) that correlates atomic structure with electronic states of metal ions within the sample. To our knowledge, such a combined methodology has not been deployed previously at a synchrotron beamline and has been restricted to XFELs. Here we describe prototype experiments along the development pathway to a combined droplet on demand diffraction and XES system at the microfocus beamline VMXi at Diamond Light Source. We demonstrate the collection of a high-quality serial diffraction data set from microcrystals within hundreds of picolitre-volume droplets deposited on a moving tape. In separate experiments at VMXi, we collected XES data from microcrystals of a copper enzyme delivered using a high viscosity extruder. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of combined droplet on demand serial crystallography and XES experiments using a third-generation synchrotron beamline; project work currently underway at Diamond Light Source.  SynopsisWe describe proof of concept experiments towards correlated serial crystallography (SSX) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) from microcrystals at a microfocus synchrotron beamline. A droplet on demand tape drive system delivers microcrystals to the beam within well-separated, hundreds of picolitre-volume droplets while XES allows validation of redox states of metals within protein crystals.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Interactions between RNA and lipids are fundamental for biological processes and are increasingly exploited for RNA delivery by lipid nanoparticles. However, RNA-lipid interactions remain challenging to characterize at the molecular level. Here, we address the modeling of RNA at lipid/water interfaces using coarse-grained (CG) simulations, experimental validation using scattering data and prediction of neutron (NR) and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) profiles from the simulations. Using neutral DOPC and cationic DOTAP bilayers, we show that lipid-RNA interactions depend strongly on RNA secondary structure, with single-stranded regions exhibiting higher interfacial affinity than double-stranded segments. We validate the CG lipid simulations, showing that while they reproduce experimental X-ray scattering data only qualitatively, the agreement improves markedly after backmap-ping to atomistic resolution followed by energy minimization and short all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We further simulated distinct tRNA conformations and analyzed the influence of RNA secondary structure, concentration, solvent contrast, and lipid deuteration on NR and XRR signals identifying the conditions under which such experiments probe RNA adsorption and discriminate between different RNA conformations. Together, these results demonstrate that CG simulations combined with reflectivity data provide a powerful approach to probe RNA adsorption and structure at lipid/water interfaces and support the design and interpretation of scattering experiments.

### The selectivity implications of docking libraries with greater and lesser similarities to bio-like molecules

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
As virtual libraries have expanded into the tens of billions via make-on-demand chemistry, their similarity to metabolites, natural products, and drugs ("bio-like" molecules) has rapidly diminished. Despite this divergence, molecular docking of these ultra-large libraries has yielded molecules at higher experimental hit-rates and with improved affinities. The structural divergence from bio-like space raises the possibility that molecules from these ultra-large libraries have improved selectivity. Just as plausibly, if hit-rates on-target are divorced from similarity to bio-like molecules, so too may be selectivity against off-targets. Here, we test whether docking hits for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor from ultra-large libraries are more selective than those from smaller and more bio-like "in-stock" libraries. Chemoinformatic similarity predicts that docking actives from the in-stock library have more off-targets than the more chemically novel hits emerging from docking the ultra-large library. This may reflect the bias of the known, however, as when tested experimentally at scale against 318 GPCRs, both 16 agonists from the ultra-large library and 20 actives from the in-stock library had similar numbers of off-targets. While the ultra-large library hits are more sub-type selective for the 5-HT2A over the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors, overall these results may suggest that selectivity against off-targets, like affinity and hit-rates for on-targets, is divorced from library similarity to bio-like molecules.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Understanding how cells migrate in response to external cues has important implications for biology, medicine, and bioengineering. Chemical, mechanical, and electrical signals are the primary drivers of directed cell migration, and each has been extensively studied over the past decades. Among them, chemical cues were the first to be investigated and remain the most widely studied due to their undeniable role in in vivo guidance. Mechanical signals--particularly substrate stiffness gradients--have gained prominence for their ubiquity across cell types and their potential to direct migration. More recently, growing evidence suggests that electrotaxis offers a highly precise and programmable means to guide cell movement. Despite this, these cues are often studied in isolation, whereas in vivo they typically coexist and interact. Using wellestablished biophysical models, we investigate how mechanical and electrical signals cooperate and how they can be engineered to compete for control over cell migration. We demonstrate that an electric field can override and even reverse durotaxis, with outcomes that depend strongly on the specific cell type. To address this large variability in controlling cell migration, we propose particular steps toward further exploration. To support such future research, we provide a freely available platform for predicting electro-mechanical interactions in cell migration, based on a given cells sensing and signaling characteristics, which could tailor the mechanical and electrical signals that arise naturally during organ development, cancer invasion, or tissue regeneration.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) mediate inhibitory neurotransmission, and their dysfunction contributes to epilepsy, anxiety, and depression. Although closed and desensitized structures of heteropentameric GABAARs are known, an open-state conformation has been difficult to capture. Here we use in-silico mutagenesis and Gaussian-accelerated MD to stabilize open-like ensembles of the 1{beta}3{gamma}2 receptor via hydrophilic substitutions at the hydrophobic 9' gate (L9'T/L9'S). The mutants expand the pore at 9' and 20' (extracellular pore entry), increase hydration and water flux, and lower Cl- permeation barriers at 9' and -2' (desensitization gate) from [~]19/[~]9 kcal mol-{superscript 1} (WT) to [~]1.3-1.6/[~]3.0-3.4 kcal mol-1, yielding ohmic conductance [~]10-30 pS in computational electrophysiology. Conformationally, the mutants show reduced twist, outward M2 tilts, and C-loop closure, consistent with activation-like signatures. On this open-like background, PAMs (diazepam, ganaxolone) primarily tune the residual -2' constriction, whereas bicuculline (orthosteric antagonist) drives a time-ordered, bottom-to-top closing sequence (-2' first, then 9'/20', then twist) via an asymmetric collapse of the M2 bundle that approaches closed-state landmarks while sampling desensitized-like ECD-TMD coupling. Two-electrode voltage clamp confirms spontaneous activity in L9'T-containing receptors, supporting the mutant-stabilized open-like ensembles. These results provide a coherent atomistic framework for gating and allosteric modulation in 1{beta}3{gamma}2 GABAARs and establish a tractable, ligand-responsive platform for state-selective structure-based design.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Iron overload cardiomyopathy (IOC) is a serious heart condition that is caused by elevated levels of systemic iron. IOC is characterized by both systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as arrhythmias. It has been challenging to isolate the cardiac-specific cellular and molecular mechanisms driving IOC because the disease affects multiple interconnected organ systems. Here, we leverage stem cell technologies, cardiac tissue engineering, and protein reconstitution assays to model key aspects of human IOC in vitro and to probe the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving cardiac dysfunction. We demonstrate that human engineered heart tissues consisting of both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts faithfully recapitulate key aspects of the human disease, including reduced systolic function, impaired diastolic function, and increased prevalence of arrhythmogenic events. We demonstrate that while both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts show increased intracellular iron levels, leading to reduced viability, cardiomyocytes show higher levels of iron accumulation and higher levels of reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, we show that in a tissue, iron overload has little effect on the action potential kinetics; however, it directly impacts the amplitude and kinetics of the calcium transient, potentially driving arrhythmogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that iron overload decreases force production, in part, through oxidative damage of sarcomeric proteins and direct iron-based inhibition of myosin. In summary, our results reveal new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of human IOC pathogenesis, and they establish new in vitro models that can be harnessed to faithfully recapitulate key aspects of the human disease phenotype.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Biosynthesis of 1-alkenes by a membrane-bound bacterial enzyme UndB from naturally abundant free fatty acids offers a promising route toward the next generation of hydrocarbon-based biofuels and industrially valuable chemicals. UndB is the only known fatty acid decarboxylase to produce 1-alkene, offering a sustainable and eco-friendly avenue for 1-alkene bioproduction. Despite the wide implications of UndB in biofuel production, its mechanism of action is unknown. Herein, we present the catalytic pathway of UndB using a suit of dynamical multiscale simulations in combination with Alphafold3 method. Our analysis reveals for the first time the existence of a dynamic iron cofactors in UndB, capable of forming a peroxodiiron(III/III) intermediate to activate molecular O2 to carry out a difficult C-H bond-breaking chemical reaction. Large-production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during UndB catalysis provide strong support for the formation of this peroxo intermediate, that is further validated by calculated activation barrier with the experimental observation. The origin of regiospecificity of the C-{beta} reaction is attributed to the substrate flexibility in the active conformation. The mechanism is fundamentally different from the proposed canonical pathway in these family of enzymes and in excellent agreement with major experimental results. This study thus opens a new window for mechanistic understanding of such integral membrane enzymes in unprecedented details.

However, there is little accepted or successful quantification of how these parameters influence nanomaterial penetration relative to biological adaptation and biological response. Part of the challenge is the response of living biological interfaces to many of these nanomaterial delivery vehicles and nanosized drugs. This study aimed to emulate key physicochemical barriers to diffusion found in living biomaterials by developing a tunable, synthetic hydrogel. Through the controlled exposure of 150 kDa and 2 MDa nanodextrans with neutral and negative surface charge, we evaluated the systems ability to emulate three core physicochemical features often implicated in biofilm-associated transport resistance: size exclusion, charge interactions, and volume exclusion. We demonstrated a 30% statistically significant decrease in partition coefficients for 2 MDa nanodextran from 150 kDa nanodextran, confirming the ability of the nanocellulose-based microcaps to mimic the permeability of hydrated biomaterial matrices. These findings reflect patterns observed in, for example, living biofilm studies, where size-based diffusion hinderance is commonly reported, but charge-based interaction and volume exclusion are more context-dependent. This controllable system can be coupled with in silico modeling to understand interfacial transport phenomena for nanomaterial-biomaterial interactions.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The brain, though less than 10% of body mass, contains about 25% of total cholesterol (CHL), emphasizing CHLs key role in neuronal function. Many CHL actions are stereospecific, as shown by differences from its 3-hydroxy epimer, epicholesterol (epiCHL). How this minor structural change alters membrane properties and sterol transport remains unclear. Here, we compare fluorescent analogs of CHL (cholestatrienol, CTL) and epiCHL (epicholestatrienol, epiCTL), which closely mimic their natural counterparts. Biophysical membrane properties, such as flip-flop, acyl-chain ordering, and interbilayer transfer, depend on the orientation of the 3-hydroxy group. Similarly, transport by sterol transport proteins (STPs) and intracellular trafficking of the sterols in human astrocytes are stereospecific. Treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol increases uptake of both epimers, but only CTL shows enhanced esterification and lipid droplet storage. These findings demonstrate that subtle cholesterol structural changes affect cellular homeostasis and establish epiCTL as a useful probe of sterol stereospecificity and trafficking.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Phase mapping is a widespread method for identifying rotational electrical activity sustaining cardiac arrhythmias. However, conventional implementations assume that the cardiac phase map is continuous, leading to ill-defined phase indices in regions affected by functional conduction block, fibrosis, or anatomical boundaries. These regions of discontinuous or undefined phase, termed phase defects, lead to both false positive and false negative detections of rotational drivers. This work introduces an improved phase mapping implementation termed extended phase mapping that explicitly detects and accounts for phase defects, enabling robust calculation of the phase index around them. Extended phase mapping is applied to (1) simulated excitation patterns using the Fenton-Karma model, (2) experimental optical mapping data of rat ventricular fibrillation, and (3) a clinical CARTO activation map of atrial tachycardia. Across all datasets, the extended approach eliminates erroneous detections and resolves previously missed rotations. Our results demonstrate that proper treatment of phase defects yields a unified and physiologically consistent characterization of all rotational drivers including near-complete and anatomical reentries. Therefore, we propose replacing the classical notion of phase singularities with critical phase defects as the fundamental entities governing rotational dynamics in cardiac tissue.  Author summaryDetecting rotating electrical activity in the heart is crucial for understanding and treating abnormal heart rhythms. A common method, phase mapping, assigns a timing phase to each region of the heart to identify these rotations. However, in regions affected by scars, blocked conduction, or anatomical boundaries, the phase can become undefined or discontinuous. These so-called phase defects make current methods unreliable, causing false detections or missed rotations. In this study, we introduce an extended method that explicitly identifies phase defects and calculates phase indices around them. We test this approach using computer simulations, experimental recordings from animal hearts, and clinical heart-mapping data. Across all datasets, it eliminates false detections and reveals previously overlooked rotational activity. By properly accounting for phase defects, the extended phase mapping method provides a more reliable and complete characterization of heart rhythms, offering a physiologically meaningful framework for studying electrical dynamics in cardiac tissue.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The pore radius distribution plays a significant role in characterizing the porous structure of powder particles, yet quantifying radii spanning 100 nm–10 µm—including both open and closed pores—remains challenging. Here, we propose a new method to measure the pore radius distribution. The method comprises two parts. First, the cross-section radius distribution is measured by an automated routine combining scanning-electron-microscopy (SEM) and deep-learning models. Second, a novel algorithm was developed to convert the cross-section radius distribution into a pore radius distribution. This requires a numerical solution to Wicksell's corpuscle problem, where the new algorithm outperforms the commonly used Saltikov-GCO method. We apply the proposed method to powder samples and compare the result with data from synchrotron X-ray tomography. Our approach provides more information on the distribution and agrees with the result of synchrotron X-ray tomography at a larger scale. As a secondary outcome, the algorithm can also be applied to geology and metallurgy when 3D grain size distribution is calculated from 2D grain size distributions.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Degradable substrates for nerve regeneration are of great interest due to the avoidance of a second surgery to remove nondegradable implants. Aerogels are a class of materials with great promise in the medical field as they have been proven to increase nerve regeneration. Therefore, degradable aerogels show promise as neuronal scaffolds. In this study, polyureacrosslinked calcium alginate (X-Ca-Alg) aerogels were studied in vitro, showing a rapid change in area, especially within the first few hours. Stiffness changes were also observed to decrease over time. Previous studies have shown an increase in regeneration rate in nerve cells with an electrical bias. Therefore, X-Ca-Alg aerogels were monitored in vitro under the influence of a DC bias. PC12 neuronal cells adhered to and extended neurites on X-Ca-Alg aerogels and showed changes based on the timeline of aerogel area change. These findings show the promising medical applications of X-Ca-Alg aerogels as degradable nerve scaffolds.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate spreads laterally, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate -crucial for engineering and natural processes -is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number (El, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number (Wi, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either El → 0 or Wi → 0, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit Wi → ∞ and El ≠ 0. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge -capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling -with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping Wi from 0 to ∞ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Small angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) are widely used tools for probing the nanoscale structures in soft materials like polymers, colloids, proteins etc. Often data interpretation is based on the fitting of a physical model to the scattering data. However, there are methods for model free data analysis that offer valuable understanding in form of the physcial parameters, while avoiding the potential artifacts induced due to the assumption of incorrect models. This tutorial systematically discusses these analysis methods in detail, starting with the key considerations for scattering experimentation and data treatment. The tutorial provides a stepwise description of the Invariant calculation for quantifying volume fraction, Guinier analysis for estimating radius of gyration and Porod analysis for determining specific surface area of scatterer. Appropriate examples from diverse systems in literature such as polymers, fibers, microemulsions, nanoparticles etc are discussed for illustration. A special emphasis has been given to the common pitfalls encountered during data analysis including the effect of polydispersity, background scattering and deviations from the ideal Porod’s behaviour. Explaining the useful protocols of data acquisition, treatment, analysis and corrections for deviations, this tutorial aims at supporting new as well as the experienced users in obtaining reliable structural insights of materials from SAXS and SANS.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We study the low energy states in a hexagonal colloidal ice realized by using repulsive paramagnetic colloids conned by gravity within a honeycomb lattice of traps. In contrast to similar systems featuring optical or topographic double wells, here we introduce eld tunable 'virtual' magnetic hills. These hills are created by placing pairs of xed paramagnetic particles close to the semicylindrical traps that contain the interacting, mobile colloids. With this strategy, a single magnetic eld can be used to simultaneously tune the particle pair-interactions and the hill elevation, without losing the trap bistability at any eld strength. We use numerical simulations to explore the rich low energy states of the system. By varying both the relative distance and magnetic content of the xed particles, not only the eects of the rst but also of the second nearest neighbors can be accessed, allowing to reach the inner charge-ordered ice-II phase. Our strategy of controlling the vertex energetics via xed, eld tunable interstitial units may be extended to other geometrically frustrated systems on dierent length scales, including nanoscale spin ice and macroscopic magnetic metamaterials.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Polymer–clay composites are produced using emulsion polymerization to create water-based formulations that exhibit reversible adhesion, which is triggered by alkaline or acidic aqueous solutions. These adhesives produce lap shear strengths greater than 1 MPa on a variety of substrates. A polyanionic composite is prepared by incorporating negatively charged montmorillonite into an emulsion of styrene and butyl acrylate with poly(acrylic acid) grafted from the particles. An analogue polycationic composite is made by integrating positively charged hydrotalcite into an emulsion stabilized by the physisorption of chitosan. When two substrates are both coated with the polycationic composite, reversibility is observed under acidic conditions, whereas polyanionic composites exhibit similar behaviour under alkaline conditions. Notably, polyanionic composites fully detach from the substrates, eliminating the need for additional washing. Clays also enhance the rheological behaviour of the emulsions, increasing the viscosity at low shear rates by up to 8 and 800 times, for polyanionic and polycationic formulations, respectively. These composite adhesives are a key development for facilitating the dismantling of products and enhancing recycling efficiency.

When active, NMDA receptors pass Ca2+-rich excitatory currents that are essential for the normal development and function of the central nervous system. In turn, fluctuations in extracellular Ca2+ levels, as observed during synaptic activity and pathological states, affect the NMDA receptor gating kinetics and conductance. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, kinetic analyses, and mutagenesis to evaluate how changes in the ambient Ca2+ concentration affect the sensitivity of recombinant NMDA receptors to open-channel blockers.

Subcellular localization prediction is crucial for understanding protein functions and cellular processes. Subcellular localization is dependent on tissue and cell lines derived from different cell types. Predicting cell line-specific subcellular localization using the information of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) offers deeper insights into dynamic cellular organization and molecular mechanisms. However, many existing PPI networks contain systematic errors that limit prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning approach, ProtLoc-GRPO, to enhance subcellular localization prediction by optimizing the structure of the underlying PPI network.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
People with unilateral transtibial amputation (uTTA) using a passive-elastic prosthesis typically walk with contact time (tc) and first and second peak vertical ground reaction force (F1 and F2) asymmetry and greater first peak external knee adduction moment in their unaffected versus affected leg. A previous study found that use of stance-phase powered prosthesis (BiOM) at a recommended power setting compared to a passive-elastic prosthesis can reduce tc asymmetry at self-selected speed and unaffected leg first peak external knee adduction moment at 1.50–1.75&nbsp;m/s. However, the BiOM includes a passive-elastic prosthesis that can have different stiffness categories and can be tuned to different power settings, which may affect tc and F1 and F2 asymmetry and unaffected leg first peak external knee adduction moment. Thirteen people with uTTA used 16 different passive-elastic prosthetic foot stiffness categories and BiOM power settings to walk at 0.75–1.75&nbsp;m/s. We found that use of the stiffest compared to least stiff category reduced F2 asymmetry. Use of the BiOM reduced tc asymmetry compared to a passive-elastic prosthesis and the effects of power setting on F1 and F2 asymmetry depended on walking speed. To minimize biomechanical asymmetry during walking at 1.25&nbsp;m/s, people with uTTA should use the BiOM with power settings up to 20% greater than those that match biological ankle joint biomechanics. Such prosthetic settings could potentially reduce unaffected leg joint pain and/or osteoarthritis risk.

### Heterogeneity dominates irreversibility in random Markov models

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We introduce a two-parameter ensemble of random discrete-time Markov models that simultaneously captures critical slowing down and broken detailed balance. Extending a previously studied heterogeneous Markov ensemble, we incorporate correlations between forward and backward transition rates through a single asymmetry parameter $γ$, while heterogeneity is controlled by $ε$. Using results from random matrix theory, we identify a critical locus $ε_c(γ,N)$ at which relaxation times diverge and spectral universality breaks down. We characterize the behavior of entropy production, predictive information, and relaxation dynamics across the ensemble, showing that many observables depend strongly on heterogeneity but only weakly on asymmetry, except near the symmetric limit. Applying maximum-likelihood inference to human fMRI and EEG data, we find that both modalities operate near the predicted critical locus and occupy a similar region of the $ε-γ$ plane, supporting a super-universality of human brain dynamics. While ensemble averages are well captured by the null model, empirical data exhibit substantially enhanced variability, indicating subject-specific structure beyond random expectations. Our results unify criticality and nonequilibrium measures within a single framework and clarify their intertwined role in the analysis of complex biological dynamics.

### Vacancy defects in square-triangle tilings and their implications for quasicrystals formed by square-shoulder particles

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Almost all observed square-triangle quasicrystals in soft-matter systems contain a large number of point-like defects, yet the role these defects play in stabilizing the quasicrystal phase remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic role of such defects in the widely observed 12-fold symmetric square-triangle quasicrystal. We develop a new Monte Carlo simulation to compute the configurational entropy of square-triangle tilings augmented to contain two types of irregular hexagons as defect tiles. We find that the introduction of defects leads to a notable entropy gain, with each defect contributing considerably more than a conventional vacancy in a periodic crystal. Intriguingly, the entropy gain is not simply due to individual defect types but isamplified by their combinatorial mixing. We then apply our findings to a microscopic model of core-corona particles interacting via a square-shoulder potential. By combining the configurational entropy with vibrational free-energy calculations, we predict the equilibrium defect concentration and confirm that the quasicrystalline phase contains a higher concentration of point-defects than a typical periodic crystal. These results provide a new understanding of the prominence of observed defects in soft-matter quasicrystals.

### The Mpemba effect in the Descartes protocol: A time-delayed Newton's law of cooling approach

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We investigate the direct and inverse Mpemba effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling by introducing and analyzing the Descartes protocol, a three-reservoir thermal scheme in which each sample undergoes a single-step quench at different times. This protocol enables a transparent separation of the roles of the delay time $τ$, the waiting time $t_{\text{w}}$, and the normalized warm temperature $ω$, thus providing a flexible setting to characterize anomalous thermal relaxation. For instantaneous quenches, exact conditions for the existence of the Mpemba effect are obtained as bounds on $ω$ for given $τ$ and $t_{\text{w}}$. Within those bounds, the effect becomes maximal at a specific value $ω=\widetildeω(t_{\text{w}})$, and its magnitude is quantified by the extremal value of the temperature-difference function at this optimum. Accurate and compact approximations for both $\widetildeω(t_{\text{w}})$ and the maximal magnitude $\text{Mp}(t_{\text{w}})$ are derived, showing in particular that the absolute maximum at fixed $τ$ is reached for $t_{\text{w}}=τ$. A comparison with a previously studied two-reservoir protocol reveals that, despite its additional control parameter, the Descartes protocol yields a smaller maximal magnitude of the effect. The analysis is extended to finite-rate quenches, where strict equality of bath conditions prevents a genuine Mpemba effect, although an approximate one survives when the bath time scale is sufficiently short. The developed framework offers a unified and analytically tractable approach that can be readily applied to other multi-step thermal protocols.

### Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.84522$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.

The conditions necessary and sufficient for the Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics (SDPD) equations of motion to have a Lagrangian that can be used for deriving these equations of motion, the Helmholtz conditions, are obtained and analysed. They show that for a finite number of SDPD particles the conditions are not satisfied; hence, the SDPD equations of motion can not be obtained using the classical Euler-Lagrange equation approach. However, when the macroscopic limit is considered, that is when the number of particles tends to infinity, the conditions are satisfied, thus providing the conceptual possibility of obtaining the Navier-Stokes equations from the principle of least action.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Missense mutations play a critical role in human disease, contributing to both inherited disorders and cancer. However, accurately predicting their functional impact—particularly for cancer driver mutations—remains a major challenge due to limited validated labels and the complex molecular basis of oncogenesis. Here, we systematically characterized over 120,000 missense variants across pathogenic, benign, driver, passenger, recurrent somatic, and common population classes, using a comprehensive set of mechanistically grounded molecular features. By assessing the statistical burden of variations, we demonstrated that these features effectively discriminate among diverse variant classes and reveal a consistent enrichment of functional sites, structural integrity, and biophysical changes in pathogenic and driver mutations. Building on these insights, we developed MutaPheno, an interpretable framework for predicting the functional consequences of missense mutations. The model integrates 34 molecular-level features, encompassing structural, functional, physicochemical, and contextual descriptors, using a random forest algorithm. Trained exclusively on pathogenic and benign variants, MutaPheno achieved strong accuracy in predicting cancer driver mutations, outperforming both cancer-specific and general pathogenicity tools, while also demonstrating superior robustness when tested on unseen proteins. Our findings highlight the shared mechanisms between pathogenic and driver mutations and emphasize the role of molecular features in improving variant interpretation. MutaPheno provides a transparent and generalizable tool that can facilitate driver discovery and the development of targeted therapies.

### Divergent Molecular Phenotypes in Point Mutations at the Same Residue in Beta-Myosin Heavy Chain Lead to Distinct Cardiomyopathies

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
In genetic cardiomyopathies, a frequently described phenomenon is how similar mutations in one protein can lead to discrete clinical phenotypes. One example is illustrated by two mutations in beta myosin heavy chain ({beta}-MHC) that are linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (Ile467Val, I467V) and left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) (Ile467Thr, I467T). To investigate how these missense mutations lead to independent diseases, we studied the molecular effects of each mutation using recombinant human {beta}-MHC Subfragment 1 (S1) in vitro assays. Both HCM-I467V and LVNC-I467T S1 mutations exhibited similar mechanochemical functions, including unchanged ATPase and enhanced actin velocity but had distinct effects on the basal activity of myosin. HCM-I467V S1 showed no change in basal ATPase activity of myosin while LVNC-I467T reduced the basal ATPase activity by 50%. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that I467T allosterically disrupts nucleotide binding of myosin, which may contribute to the uncoupled reduced basal activity and enhanced actin velocity observed in this mutation. These contrasting molecular effects may lead to contractile dysregulation that initiates LVNC-associated signaling pathways that progress the phenotype. Together, analysis of these mutations provides evidence that phenotypic complexity originates at the molecular level and is critical to understanding disease progression and developing therapies.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Homooligomerisation is a prevalent and important process that many proteins undergo to form the quaternary structures required for biological function. However, determining oligomeric states and structures experimentally remains technically challenging and time-consuming for many proteins. Here, we show that the protein structure prediction tools AlphaFold2-Multimer and AlphaFold3 can be used to quickly and accurately predict oligomeric states and structures for a range of soluble and membrane proteins. Using a benchmark set of 40 proteins, we provide optimal parameters for minimizing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. We further extended this analysis to a large dataset of over 1,000 proteins using AlphaFold2-Multimer and observe comparable overall performance but find that accurate oligomeric state prediction remains challenging for proteins that lack close structural representatives in the AlphaFold training set. Together, our results suggest both the utility and current limitations of AlphaFold-based oligomeric state prediction, highlight cases where multiple physiologically relevant assemblies may be plausible, and provide practical guidance for applying these methods to proteins lacking experimental structural data.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Hyaluronan (HA), a heteropolysaccharide of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA), is an essential component of the vertebrate extracellular matrix. HA biosynthesis proceeds via three evolutionarily convergent reaction mechanisms, catalyzed by the membrane integrated class 1 enzymes that either elongate the non-reducing (NR) or reducing end of HA, as well as the class 2 hyaluronan synthase (HAS), a soluble non-processive enzyme. Class 1-NR HAS, found in both vertebrates and large double-stranded DNA viruses, is monomeric and couples HA polymerization via coordinated transfer of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcA substrates with the secretion of the nascent HA chain through its own transmembrane channel. How this HAS discriminates between two UDP-sugars using a single active site is a critical, yet unresolved question. Using single-particle cryo-EM, we reveal a two-step process by which the Chlorella virus HAS (CvHAS) recognizes and positions its substrate, UDP-GlcA, for glycosyl transfer. Further, we report greatly diminished turnover of UDP-GlcA in the absence of a primer, distinguishing acceptor free activity toward UDP-GlcNAc. Lastly, prompted by observation of a dodecyl maltoside bound HAS, we demonstrate the utility of non-canonical acceptors in priming of a UDP-GlcA transfer reaction. Altogether, this work clarifies the molecular basis for HAS dual substrate specificity and the role of UDP-GlcA recognition in integrity of HA synthesis.

### Sequence-context-aware decoding enables robust reconstruction of protein dynamics from crystallographic B-factors

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
While X-ray crystallography remains the primary source of protein structures, the B-factors associated with these coordinates are frequently obscured by crystal packing and refinement artifacts that limit their utility for quantifying solutionstate dynamics. We address the disparity between static structural abundance and dynamic information scarcity by introducing the B-Factor Corrector. This fine-tuned protein language model redefines B-factor analysis as a sequenceto-dynamics translation task rather than a purely physical calculation. By leveraging deep contextual embeddings to decouple intrinsic flexibility from lattice constraints, our model recovers ground-truth conformational fluctuations derived from structural ensembles and achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.80. We further demonstrate the utility of these sequence-inferred dynamics in structural biology applications where the model identifies binding-competent conformations for flexible molecular docking, unmasks cryptic mechanical hinges essential for chaperone function, and guides the energetic refinement of antibody interfaces to resolve steric conflicts. These results suggest that static crystallographic data can be effectively repurposed to decode accurate dynamic patterns latent within the Protein Data Bank.

### Resolving Conformational Heterogeneity in IntrinsicallyDisordered Proteins via Experimentally Guided Multi-Replica Simulations

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The conformational landscapes of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) remain obscured by the ensemble averaging inherent to experimental observables. Here, we present Multi-replica Averaged Restraint Simulation (MARS), a data-driven modeling framework that reconstructs these landscapes by enforcing ensemble-averaged restraints across multiple replicas without imposing prior structural knowledge. Using the N-terminal domain of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-NTD) as a model system, MARS simultaneously integrates small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and six paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) profiles, comprising over 600 pairwise restraints, to generate ensembles that quantitatively fit all input structural restraints. The resulting ensemble is consistent with independent backbone relaxation measurements and reveals two major conformational states: a dominant extended state and a low-populated yet functionally relevant compact state whose structural features align with prior mutagenesis studies. Systematic benchmarking demonstrates that SAXS and PRE provide orthogonal global and local constraints, that each PRE profile contributes non-redundant structural information, and that multi-replica sampling is essential for preserving conformational heterogeneity. MARS offers a scalable framework for integrating orthogonal biophysical measurements to resolve both dominant and rare functional states in IDPs.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Biomolecular assembly is a cornerstone of cellular organisation and function. Revealing its underlying principles is essential for understanding biological processes, and their malfunction in disease. Viral capsid assembly is the archetypal self-assembly system that has been central in establishing the fundamental principles of biological self-assembly, providing a conceptual and geometric framework that underpins the current understanding of supramolecular biomolecular systems, the development of new biomaterials, and advancing therapeutic design. Yet, despite decades of experimental efforts, observation and quantification of virus self-assembly pathways and dynamics have remained elusive. Here, we combine mass photometry with a non-perturbative single molecule trapping method, enabling direct, real-time monitoring of the self-assembly of individual virus-like particles (VLPs) with molecular resolution. We show that weak, diffusion-limited, and reversible multivalent interactions control the assembly process by facilitating stochastic selection of a limited set of on-path, topologically closed intermediates. Assembly is finely tuned by the transition rates between these topologically closed configurations and proceeds through a sequence of effectively irreversible first-passage events. The intrinsic first-passage times are a consequence of VLP symmetry, creating a separation of timescales between the formation of the first closed intermediate and subsequent elongation. This separation results in a nucleation and growth mechanism that yields an equilibrium distribution consistent with the law of mass action, despite the overall irreversibility of assembly. Our approach enables direct and complete characterisation of both the thermodynamics and the kinetics governing VLP assembly and reveals how the system achieves specific assembly of one final structure with high fidelity despite the availability of thousands of assembly intermediates. More broadly, our approach provides a general framework for visualising and quantifying the dynamics of multimeric biological machines at the molecular level.

### Structural Mechanisms of SAMD9 Autoinhibition and Pathogenic Dysregulation

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
SAMD9 and SAMD9L (SAMD9/9L) are large cytosolic proteins essential for hematopoietic homeostasis and antiviral defense1-3. Germline gain-of-function (GoF) mutations in SAMD9/9L cause severe multisystem disorders and predisposition to leukemia, yet the mechanisms that regulate SAMD9/9L activity and how pathogenic mutations disrupt these processes, remain poorly understood. Here, we determine cryo-electron microscopy structures of human SAMD9 in multiple conformational and oligomeric states. We show that SAMD9 predominantly adopts a closed, autoinhibited conformation stabilized by a central ATP-bound nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) and an extensive network of intramolecular interactions. Recurrent patient-derived GoF mutations localize to and destabilize these intramolecular interfaces, and restoring the disrupted interactions through compensatory mutations reinstates autoinhibition. We further identify low-abundance asymmetric SAMD9 dimers in which one protomer undergoes large conformational changes and establishes intermolecular interactions that are essential for SAMD9 activation. Together, these findings define the structural basis of SAMD9 autoinhibition and explain how human GoF mutations subvert this regulatory mechanism to drive disease.

### Batrachotoxin Sensitive Sodium Channels in Toxic Birds Challenge "Target Mutation" Strategy of Toxin Autoresistance

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) are essential for muscle and nerve activity, and are therefore prime targets of natural toxins. Batrachotoxin (BTX) is uniquely potent among NaV-directed alkaloids. Southern and Central American Phyllobates poison dart frogs and multiple species of New Guinean toxic birds accumulate dietary BTX without self-poisoning. Two broad autoresistance models have been proposed: 1) "target mutation," in which NaV substitutions reduce BTX action, and 2) "toxin sequestration," in which high-affinity binding proteins or compartmentalization limit toxin access to channels. A recent report identified two NaV1.4 substitutions, D1050N and S1568P, under positive selection in toxic birds, including two newly discovered BTX-bearing birds, Pachycephala schlegelii and Aleadryas rufinucha, and suggested a "target mutation" strategy for these passerines. Here, we test that hypothesis using structure-guided mapping and electrophysiology. The substitutions map to solvent-exposed positions tens of angstroms away from inner-cavity BTX sites, inconsistent with direct effects on BTX binding. Heterologously expressed mutant channels exhibit wild-type activation and steady-state inactivation, lacking the biophysical "costs" typical of pore-lining resistance mutations. Importantly, all constructs remain fully BTX-sensitive, showing canonical shifts in activation and persistent currents upon toxin exposure. These data argue that NaV1.4 substitutions do not confer BTX autoresistance in toxic birds. This finding, together with prior work in BTX-carrying frogs and birds, is consistent with a generalized sequestration model. Identifying the responsible BTX-binding factors could enable antidote design and broaden strategies for neutralizing NaV-targeting toxins.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Dissipation in soft matter and living systems is highly heterogeneous, giving rise to complex local entropy production patterns. Recent work has identified the connection between local entropy production and locally extractable amount of work. This suggests that locally produced entropy can be recovered to power nanorobots and biological machines, prompting the need for efficient strategies to modulate and fine-tune local entropy production. In this work, we propose to program entropy production hotspots by leveraging local interaction patterns and test this approach in simulations of a fluid driven through a nanopore or past an obstacle. The results show that patterning the surface of the pore with a repulsive patch gives rise to an entropy production hotspot around the patch, while an attractive patch leads to an entropy production cold spot. Varying the strength of the interaction and width of the patch enables modulating the hotness and extent of the hot spot. In flows past interaction patterned-obstacles, we show that the combined effects of steric hindrance and attraction allows to program a specific entropy production map, thereby opening the door to the precise powering of nanomachines.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Microplastics are becoming increasingly abundant waste products; therefore, the risk of human exposure is also increasing. The cytotoxic consequences of microplastic exposure, particularly in cancer, have yet to be explored. We obtained commercially available polystyrene nanoparticles of uniform size (86.61 ± 6.41 nm) and confirmed the chemical composition and shape using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. We evaluated colloidal stability over a range of concentrations from 1–1000 µg mL−1 using hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential, determining that higher concentrations exhibit greater colloidal stability compared to lower concentrations. Specifically, the zeta potential increased from very negative values of approximately −40 mV to approximately zero mV. To evaluate the cytotoxic effects of these microplastics, we evaluated the relative cell viability in vitro of HeLa cervical cancer cells, including those with DNA damage repair deficiencies in MLH1 and MSH2. High concentrations of polystyrene were required for observable decreases in cell viability, particularly in esterase activity measured with calcein AM. Cellular internalization of the nanoparticles was confirmed quantitatively using intracellular fluorescence and qualitatively using confocal microscopy for fluorescent polystyrene. Overall, these results indicate that high concentrations of polystyrene are required to elicit toxicological effects in cervical cells within 24 hours.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
During the process of colloidal adsorption, colloids (physically or chemically) attach to the surface of a solid. This mechanism plays a crucial role in numerous applications, including water purification, materials synthesis, and catalyst formation. The adhesion of colloids is driven by intermolecular forces between the colloids and the surface, which are predominantly electrostatic. However, entropic forces can also be exploited to selectively induce a specific or preferred distribution of colloids in the vicinity of the surface of the wall. In this work, we report the entropic potential between walls and large particles immersed in a bath of small particles, with a focus on how varying wall geometries influence this entropic potential.Three types of wall geometries are examined: flat, concave, and convex. This wall-particle entropic potential is then used in Monte Carlo computer simulations to perform a more realistic analysis of the particle organization at finite colloidal concentration. For the wall, we particularly explore a rectangular microchannel-like configuration, which is created by the superposition of two step-edge walls separated by a given distance; we have chosen this kind of wall morphology, as it is the most popular configuration in microfluidic experiments. Our findings indicate that the strongest attraction on a colloidal particle occurs when it is near a concave surface. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations in a microchannel-like geometry reveal an optimal relationship between the channel gap and the colloid adsorption. More specifically, the adsorption coefficient exhibits a maximum at a well-defined channel gap. These findings are relevant for the design of microfluidic devices, where adsorption can be enhanced and controlled by tuning physical parameters or device geometry, enabling targeted particle localization in regions of high or low particle concentration.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Understanding the buried interface between silica and epoxy resin is crucial for improving the performance and reliability of epoxy composites and adhesives. Here, molecular dynamics simulations were used to reveal a heterogeneous molecular picture of aggregation and curing at the amorphous silica/epoxy interface. A density increase was observed within 2 nm of the interface, driven by the orientation and packing of epoxy and amine molecules. Smaller amines segregated near the substrate, accelerating interfacial curing in the early stages. However, subsequent reactions slowed due to restricted mobility, resulting in a ∼10% lower conversion than in the bulk. Unreacted monomers and isolated fragments accumulated near the interface, indicating adverse effects on adhesion. These findings provide molecular-level insights into buried interfaces and inform strategies for improving adhesion and reliability in epoxy-based composites and adhesives.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We experimentally investigate how drying history influences microparticle–substrate adhesion in hydrophilic systems. By systematically varying air temperature, relative humidity, and drying duration under controlled conditions, we quantify the detachment force of individual microparticles. Air temperature emerges as the dominant factor: higher temperatures and lower humidity enhance adhesion, while prolonged drying generally reduces it—except under combined high-temperature and low-humidity conditions, where strong adhesion persists. Complementary Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) reveals drying-time-dependent changes in the particle–substrate contact size, consistent with capillary-induced compression of the contact zone followed by partial relaxation. These findings indicate that transient capillary stresses during evaporation deform the particle–substrate interface and leave a lasting imprint on adhesion strength. Overall, the study shows how capillarity, drying dynamics, and contact mechanics couple to regulate adhesion in colloidal systems, offering new insights into particle–substrate interactions in soft matter contexts.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The crystallization of hard spheres at equilibrium is perhaps the most familiar example of an entropically-driven phase transition. In recent years, it has become clear that activity can dramatically alter this order-disorder transition in unexpected ways. The theoretical description of active crystallization has remained elusive as the traditional thermodynamic arguments that shape our understanding of passive freezing are inapplicable to active systems. Here, we develop a statistical mechanical description of the one-body density field and a nonconserved order parameter field that represents local crystalline order. We develop equations of state, guided by computer simulations, describing the crystallinity field which result in shifting the order-disorder transition to higher packing fractions with increasing activity. We then leverage our recent dynamical theory of coexistence to construct the full phase diagram of active Brownian spheres, quantitatively recapitulating both the solid-fluid and liquid-gas coexistence curves along with the solid-liquid-gas triple point.

A significant proportion of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases exhibit a substantial copy number expansion of the hexanucleotide GGGGCC/GGCCCC sequence in the C9ORF72 gene. The GGGGCC sequence forms a non-canonical DNA structure called a G-quadruplex (G4) which has been associated with the disease states and with nucleic acid condensate formation. G4s can fold into various topologies, which can differentially impact fidelity of DNA synthesis. However, how G4 conformational heterogeneity and its regulation impact hexanucleotide repeat expansion is unclear, and important clues may lie in the thermodynamic properties of different G4 topologies.

Biomolecular condensates exhibit a wide range of viscoelastic properties, shaped by their molecular sequences and compositions. Coarse-grained molecular models of intrinsically disordered proteins are widely used to complement experimental data by revealing the structures and thermodynamics of condensates. However, fully flexible chain representations of intrinsically disordered proteins often fail to capture their complex viscoelastic behavior, instead predicting purely viscous responses. In this work, we demonstrate that introducing sequence-dependent chain rigidity enables us to reproduce the experimentally observed trends in the elastic and viscous moduli for A1-LCD condensates and their variants.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Chromatin organisation and transcriptional regulation are tightly coordinated processes that are essential for maintaining cellular identity and function. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins play critical roles in control of genome structure and in regulating transcription across eukaryotes. Their essential nature, however, has made it difficult to define exactly how these functions are mediated. The chromatin remodeller CHD4 has been shown to be capable of sliding nucleosomes in vitro, and to regulate chromatin accessibility and gene expression in vivo. Using an inducible depletion system, here we identify a second mechanism of action for CHD4 in actively restricting the residence time of transcription factors (TFs) on chromatin. Together, these activities result in distinct, context-dependent outcomes: at highly accessible regulatory elements, CHD4 limits TF binding to maintain regulatory function, while at low-accessibility euchromatic regions, it prevents TF engagement and sustains chromatin compaction, thereby silencing cryptic enhancers. Collectively, these mechanisms enable CHD4 to reduce transcriptional noise while preserving the responsiveness of active regulatory networks.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Movement flexibility and automaticity are necessary to successfully navigate different environments. When encountering difficult terrains such as a muddy trail, we can change how we step almost immediately so that we can continue walking. This flexibility comes at a cost since we initially must pay deliberate attention to how we are moving. Gradually, after a few minutes on the trail, stepping becomes automatic so that we do not need to think about our movements. Canonical theory indicates that different adaptive motor learning mechanisms confer these essential properties to movement: explicit control confers rapid flexibility, while forward model recalibration confers automaticity. Here, we uncover a distinct mechanism of treadmill walking adaptation – an automatic stimulus-response mapping – that confers both properties to movement. The mechanism is flexible as it learns stepping patterns that can be rapidly changed to suit a range of treadmill configurations. It is also automatic as it can operate without deliberate control or explicit awareness by the participants. Our findings reveal a tandem architecture of forward model recalibration and automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for walking, reconciling different findings of motor adaptation and perceptual realignment.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Networks of aromatic amino acid residues within microtubules, particularly those formed by tryptophan, may serve as pathways for optical information flow. Ultraviolet excitation dynamics in these networks are typically modeled with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. By extending this approach to a Lindblad master equation that incorporates explicit site geometries and dipole orientations, we track how correlations are generated, routed, and dissipated, while capturing both energy dissipation and information propagation among coupled chromophores. We compare localized injections, fully delocalized preparations, and eigenmode-based initial states. To quantify the emerging quantum-informational structure, we evaluate the $L_1$ norm of coherence, the correlated coherence, and the logarithmic negativity within and between selected chromophore sub-networks. The results reveal a strong dependence of both the direction and persistence of information flow on the type of initial preparation. Superradiant components drive the rapid export of correlations to the environment, whereas subradiant components retain them and slow their leakage. Embedding single tubulin units into larger dimers and spirals reshapes pairwise correlation maps and enables site-selective routing. Scaling to larger ordered lattices strengthens both export and retention channels, whereas static energetic and structural disorder suppresses long-range transport and reduces overall correlation transfer. These findings provide a Lindbladian picture of information flow in cytoskeletal chromophore networks and identify structural and dynamical conditions that transiently preserve nonclassical correlations in microtubules.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Soft, microscale hydrogel fibers and rods play important roles in tissue engineering, flexible electronics, soft robotics, drug delivery, sensors, and other applications. Their viscoelastic mechanical properties, while critical for their function, can be challenging to characterize. We present a flow-induced bending response (FIBR) rheometer that quantifies the bending modulus and viscoelastic properties of small, hydrated fibers and rods using flow through a glass capillary. The fiber is positioned across the capillary entrance, and pressure-driven, controlled inflow of water exerts a quantifiable force on the sample. Fiber deflection is determined by video microscopy obtained simultaneously with measurements of flow rate. We develop an analytical model to resolve the hydrodynamic forces applied to the rod, and use Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to determine its material properties. Using a constant volume flow rate of water enables measurement of steady rod deflection, and thus the bending modulus. Application of viscous forces to the rod in a stepwise, cyclic or oscillatory manner enables measurement of time-dependent responses, creep recovery, viscoelastic moduli, and other properties. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique on natural and synthetic materials spanning diameters from 1 to 500 microns and elastic moduli ranging from 100 Pa to >100 MPa. Because the technique uses water to exert forces on the fiber, it works particularly well for hydrated materials, such as hydrogels and biological fibers, providing a versatile platform to characterize microscale mechanical properties of elongated structures.

### Unbounded Systematic Error in Thin Film Conductivity Measurements

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain the gold standard for studying protein dynamics, but their computational cost limits access to biologically relevant timescales. Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<p>by Joanna Danielewicz, Guillaume Girier, Anton Chizhov, Mathieu Desroches, Juan-Manuel Encinas, Serafim Rodrigues</p>  In response to prolonged depolarizing current steps, different classes of neurons display specific firing characteristics (i.e., excitability class), such as a regular train of action potentials with more or less adaptation, delayed responses, or bursting. In general, one or more specific ionic transmembrane currents underlie the different firing patterns. Here, we sought to investigate the influence of artificial sodium-like (Na channels) and slow potassium-like (KM channels) voltage-gated channels conductances on firing patterns and transition to depolarization block (DB) in Dentate Gyrus granule cells with dynamic clamp - a computer-controlled real-time closed-loop electrophysiological technique, which allows to couple mathematical models simulated in a computer with biological cells. Our findings indicate that the mimicked extra Na/KM channels significantly affect the firing rate of low-frequency cells, but not that of high-frequency cells. Moreover, we have observed that 44 percent of recorded cells exhibited what we have called a “flipping” behavior. This means that these cells were able to overcome the DB and generate trains of action potentials at higher current injection steps. We have developed a mathematical model of “flipping" cells to explain this phenomenon. Based on our computational model, we conclude that the appearance of “flipping" is linked to the number of states for the sodium channel of the model.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Understanding how the physical properties of a fluid influence bacterial behavior is essential for explaining how microorganisms interact with their environment and with animal hosts. Here, we examine how changes in fluid viscosity and rheological properties affect the locomotion of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its ability to produce luminescence through cell--cell communication. We track the three-dimensional motion of single cells in well-defined fluids with different physical properties and measure the luminescence emitted by cell populations. We find that fluids with higher viscosity cause V. fischeri to spend more time in a slower, turning-focused swimming mode, which reduces how effectively cells spread out and encounter the chemical signals required to activate luminescence. As a result, luminescence first increases and then decreases in Newtonian fluids, but decreases monotonically in fluids that exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behavior. Computer simulations based on our measurements confirm that the ability of cells to explore their surroundings plays a central role in determining when and how strongly they communicate. These findings reveal a direct link between the physical environment, bacterial movement, and collective behavior, and offer new insight into how microorganisms adapt to complex fluid habitats, including those found inside animal hosts.

Babesia microti
                    is an intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite and the main causative agent of human babesiosis in the United States. While extensive research has focused on the prevalence of this vector-borne pathogen in natural populations, increases of human cases and clinical manifestation, and pathogen structure, little is known about the movements of
                    B. microti
                    within vertebrate red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs are nonmotile due to their lack of cellular structures for active movement. Here, we report a phenomenon in which
                    B. microti
                    –infected RBCs exhibit an acquired motility compared to uninfected RBCs. Using live-cell tracking, we observed a subset (around 1% in whole blood and 10% in 1:100 diluted blood) of infected RBCs displayed active movement. This acquired motility suggests that
                    B. microti
                    may induce host cell modifications that facilitate its survival, dissemination, or immune evasion potential, allowing it to successfully move through the blood and infect new RBCs. Our findings highlight unconventional RBC dynamics and a potential broad aspect of
                    B. microti
                    pathogenesis. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon could provide insights into parasite–host interactions and reveal targets for therapeutic intervention in treatment and/or prevention of babesiosis.

### A Three-State Thermodynamically Consistent Cross-Bridge Model for Muscle Contraction
**Source:** arXiv

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Muscle contraction is a prototypical multiscale chemomechanical process in which ATP hydrolysis at the molecular level drives force generation and mechanical work at larger scales. A long-standing challenge is to connect microscopic cross-bridge dynamics to macroscopic observables while retaining an explicit, thermodynamically consistent energetic budget for chemical-to-mechanical transduction. Here we use the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA) to unify Hill's cycle-affinity viewpoint with Huxley's sliding-filament mechanics within a single thermodynamically closed framework. We formulate a three-state Fokker--Planck-jump description for cross-bridge populations evolving on state-dependent free-energy landscapes, in which ATP hydrolysis enters through local detailed balance and biases the transition rates. Filament sliding velocity is incorporated as a convective transport mechanism in the Fokker--Planck dynamics, so that mechanical power exchange with the external motion emerges transparently from the resulting energy-dissipation law together with chemical input and irreversible dissipation. Under chemostatted conditions and a fast-equilibration closure for the attached substates, the model reduces to a closed two-state molecular motor description; in a further singular limit, this reduction recovers a Huxley-type transport-reaction equation. Proof-of-concept simulations of the reduced model reproduce a Hill-like force-velocity relation and show how ATP availability modulates the force-velocity curve while preserving its characteristic Hill-type shape.

### Depth and slip ratio dependencies of friction for a sphere rolling on a granular slope

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We experimentally investigate the dynamics of a sphere rolling down a granular slope by varying the initial velocity, slope angle, and sphere density. The results show that the sphere rolls down with constant deceleration while sinking into the granular bed. $δ/R$ (the sinking depth $δ$ normalized to the sphere radius $R$) is scaled by the sphere density normalized by the bulk density of the granular layer. To evaluate the translational energy dissipation, we introduce an effective friction coefficient $μ_\mathrm{d}$. We demonstrate that $μ_\mathrm{d}$ decreases with increasing the slope angle and the slip ratio. Furthermore, systematic measurements over a wide range of sphere densities reveal that $μ_\mathrm{d}$ increases linearly with $δ/R$ : $μ_\mathrm{d}=β(δ/R)+μ_0$. The value of $μ_0$ is linearly decreasing with slip ratio and its coefficient $β(\simeq0.41)$ does not vary significantly. The results suggest that the normalized depth and slip ratio determine the effective friction of a rolling sphere.

### Thermodynamic cost-controllability tradeoff in metabolic currency coupling

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Cellular metabolism is globally regulated by various currency metabolites such as ATP, GTP, and NAD(P)H. These metabolites cycle between charged (high-energy) and uncharged (low-energy) states to mediate energy transfer. While distinct currency metabolites are associated with different metabolic functions, their charged and uncharged forms are generally interchangeable via biochemical reactions such as ${\rm ATP{\,+\,}GDP{\,\rightleftharpoons\,}ADP{\,+\,}GTP}$ and $\rm NADP^+{\,+\,}NADH{\,\rightleftharpoons\,}NADPH{\,+\,}NAD^+ $. Thus, their energetic states are generally coupled and influence each other, which would hinder the independent regulation of different currency metabolites. Despite the extensive knowledge of the molecular biology of individual currency metabolites, it remains poorly understood how the coordination of various coupled currency metabolites shapes metabolic regulation, efficiency, and ultimately the evolution of organisms. Here, we present a minimal theoretical model of metabolic currency coupling and reveal a fundamental tradeoff relationship between metabolic controllability and thermodynamic cost: increasing the capacity to independently regulate multiple currency metabolites generally requires comparable abundances of those metabolites, which in turn incurs a higher entropy production rate. The tradeoff suggests that in complex environments, organisms evolutionarily favor an equal abundance of currency metabolites to enhance metabolic controllability at the expense of a higher thermodynamic cost; conversely, in simple environments, organisms evolve to have imbalanced amounts of them to reduce heat dissipation. These considerations also offer a hypothesis regarding evolutionary trends in nucleotide-pool balance and genomic GC content.

### Freezing-Melting Mediated Dewetting Transition for Droplets on Superhydrophobic Surfaces with Condensation
**Source:** arXiv

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The water-repellence properties of superhydrophobic surfaces make them promising for many applications. However, in some extreme environments, such as high humidities and low temperatures, condensation on the surface is inevitable, which induces the loss of surface superhydrophobicity. In this study, we propose a freezing-melting strategy to achieve the dewetting transition from the Wenzel state to the Cassie-Baxter state. It requires freezing the droplet by reducing the substrate temperature and then melting the droplet by heating the substrate. The condensation-induced wetting transition from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel state is analyzed first. Two kinds of superhydrophobic surfaces, i.e., single-scale nano-structured superhydrophobic surface and hierarchical-scale micro-nano-structured superhydrophobic surface, are compared and their effects on the static contact states and impact processes of droplets are analyzed. The mechanism for the dewetting transition is analyzed by exploring the differences in the micro/nano-structures of the surfaces and it is attributed to the unique structure and strength of the superhydrophobic surface. These findings will enrich our understanding of the droplet-surface interaction involving phase changes and have great application prospects for the design of superhydrophobic surfaces.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The bacterial flagellar motor enables bacteria to swim by rotating helical flagellar filaments that form a bundle at the back of the cell. Escherichia colis motor uses the energy stored in the electrochemical gradient of protons, the proton motive force (PMF), to generate the torque driving this rotation. Until now, motor speed was thought to be proportional to the PMF, irrespective of the viscous load on the motor, and across the physiological range of PMF values. Here, we show that the PMF-speed relationship is non-linear in the high-torque regime. Because saturation in the relationship occurs in the physiologically relevant range, it challenges all current models of motor function that assume a tight coupling between the motor rotation and PMF across the entire physiological range. Furthermore, we experimentally determine the load on the motor experienced by swimming cells, and show that free swimming occurs close to or within the saturation regime, making the observed limiting torque evolutionary relevant.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Antifolate resistance in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfDHFR) remains a major challenge for malaria control. To understand how this enzyme maintains function under antifolate selection, we developed PfPATH, a computational framework that integrates mutational fitness measurements, evolutionary interactions, and structural information to map adaptive trajectories. PfPATH adaptive walks reveal that evolution is constrained to a narrow ridge in sequence space defined by a small subset of residues. Most resistance mutations are individually deleterious and become viable only when supported by stabilizing changes, restricting adaptation to a few high-resistance pathways. Structure network analyses show that these mutations do not disrupt the global enzyme architecture but instead reorganize internal communication to preserve catalytic function. Consistent with this, molecular dynamics and free-energy analyses indicate that resistant variants remain stable while sampling a broader ensemble of low-energy conformational substates. Together, these results reveal a narrow and predictable route to antifolate escape.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Biomolecular condensates form dynamic compartments that regulate biochemical reactions in cells. Condensates recruit many kinases and regulate their enzymatic activity. Condensates alter the rate of enzymatic reactions through several opposing effects, so it is unclear whether these mostly enhance or retard phosphorylation. Here, we use a synthetic condensate formed by intrinsically disordered proteins to show that slow diffusion in the condensate controls phosphorylation kinetics in the dense phase. We vary the length of substrates by appending phase-separating repeat proteins of different lengths, in order to study how phosphorylation depends on partitioning, diffusion and volume fraction across substrate motifs with different intrinsic kinetics. The condensate environment is generally inhibitory to phosphorylation, although the enzyme remains intact. This inhibition is partially offset by an enhanced reaction rate in the dilute phase, likely due to soluble nanoclusters. Phosphorylation rates are strongly correlated to diffusion coefficients of substrates in the condensate, suggesting mass-transport limitation. Our results suggest that condensates can modify the substrate usage of a kinase via different trade-offs between diffusion and partitioning. We suggest that diffusion limitations are likely a common feature of many macromolecular reactions in condensates, and that high fluidity is crucial for condensates to act as reaction crucibles.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles involved in metabolic regulation and cellular stress responses, yet their biochemical heterogeneity and treatment-dependent remodeling in the context of radiotherapy remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first label-free Raman spectroscopic analysis of isolated lipid droplets (iLDs) from normal Schwann cells and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells subjected to cannabidiol (CBD) treatment, ionizing radiation, and their combination. Raman spectroscopy revealed pronounced chemical heterogeneity of iLDs both between and within cell types, reflecting differences in acyl chain organization, conformational order, and lipid class composition. CBD treatment induced substantial lipid remodeling in Schwann cells, giving rise to multiple iLD subpopulations, whereas MPNST cells exhibited a more constrained response. Irradiation altered lipid droplet heterogeneity in a cell-type-dependent manner, while combined CBD treatment and irradiation induced characteristic alterations in LD cargo that differed markedly between Schwann and MPNST cells, highlighting lipid droplets as sensitive reporters of metabolic reprogramming and stress adaptation. Overall, these findings establish Raman-based lipid droplet profiling as a powerful approach for resolving treatment-specific metabolic remodeling at the suborganelle level and provide new insight into lipid-mediated mechanisms underlying radiosensitization in cancer cells.

A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 peptides differ by just two C-terminal residues, yet they display strikingly different aggregation and toxicity profiles. Whether this distinction is already encoded at the monomer level is still under debate. Here, we combine extensive all-atom simulations in explicit solvent, well-tempered metadynamics, and a tailored consensus cluster analysis to compare the monomeric ensembles of the two isoforms under identical conditions. Both peptides populate broad, coil-like conformational distributions; however, A{beta}42 shows systematically higher {beta}-structure propensity, especially in the C-terminal region, and samples more extended conformations with higher hydrophobic exposure compared to A{beta}40. These results support a mechanistic link between sequence-encoded monomer conformational preferences and the differential amyloidogenicity of the two isoforms, highlighting monomer-level determinants of A{beta}42s distinct aggregation behavior.

### Simulating Thermoresponsive Behavior of Disordered Proteins with Temperature-Dependent Coarse-Grained Potentials Derived from Hydration Free Energies

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Thermoresponsive phase transitions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), including both upper critical solution temperature (UCST) and lower critical solution temperature (LCST) transitions, are widely observed in natural and synthetic sequences. However, most existing coarse-grained (CG) models employ temperature-independent interactions and fail to capture solvation-driven LCST behavior. To address this, we introduce TEA (Temperature-dependent Energetics derived from hydrAtion free energies), a physics-based framework that augments CG models with temperature-dependent interactions derived from hydration thermodynamics. Leveraging extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that inter-residue interaction strengths quantified by excess free energies correlate linearly with hydration free energies. This correlation, combined with a validated combination rule for heterotypic interactions, allows the derivation of temperature-dependent potentials across continuous temperature space. We map these atomistic energetics to CG potentials via a single global scaling parameter, ensuring minimal overfitting and high transferability. The TEA-augmented CG models robustly distinguish UCST- and LCST-type sequences, successfully identify experimentally reported outliers, and accurately reproduce LCST-type single-chain compaction trends and phase diagrams of multiple disordered proteins. Collectively, our work provides a transferable and physically interpretable framework that bridges atomistic hydration thermodynamics and phase behavior of IDPs, enabling the simulation of thermoresponsive sequences with minimal phenomenological fitting.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
As we know, bacterial motion navigates complex environments in natural settings, providing a basis for scientific study to understand their dynamics. Hydrodynamics drive wall alignment and accumulation, but research remains unclear about the extent to which confinement alone, without hydrodynamics, modulates bacterial dynamics.  Therefore, we develop a 2D model to study the effects of isolated steric and hydrodynamic forces on bacterial motion in 10- and 50-m microchannels. We used bacteria to model self-propelled rigid rods with run-and-tumble motion, and then compared dry systems (purely steric wall effects) with wet systems (hydrodynamic effects). We found that bacterial speeds and their orientation are independent of channel dimensions in dry systems. In wet systems, we observed strong wall-hugging and alignment due to wall-induced hydrodynamic interactions, enhanced residence times, and a slight increase in the observable effective speed in 10 m microchannels compared to 50 m channels (where bacteria-maintained bulk-like dynamics). Our study thus emphasises when confinement affects bacterial motion solely due to pure dry geometry, and when hydrodynamics play an essential role. This study provides a template for microfluidics-based experimental prediction of bacterial dynamics and could be applied to an analysis of antibiotic resistance.  Significance StatementMicrobes rely on self-propelled motion to navigate complex environmental systems and survive and persist. In such an environment, physical interactions with surrounding boundaries play a key role in how bacteria move, orient, or settle in complex spaces. Although many studies show that hydrodynamic forces near walls influence how bacteria swim in liquid, there is still confusion about whether confinement, with or without hydrodynamic effects, can change the complete bacterial pattern. Our 2D model shows that confinement (purely steric wall effects, dry limit) alone does not alter bacterial motion patterns. It is the hydrodynamics (wet limit) that drives bacteria to orient toward walls, remain near boundaries, and direct motion in narrow channels. This work clarifies when confinement and hydrodynamics actually affect bacterias motion and provides a practical way to understand bacterial behaviour in biological systems, including in microfluidic applications and studies of antibiotic resistance strategies.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Proteins operate in dynamic environments where ions, lipids, and temperature collectively define their properties, yet most studies rely on simplified conditions that overlook these intrinsic variables. Here, we show two such factors--temperature and Ca2+--profoundly remodel the function and pharmacology of TRPM4, an ion channel implicated in cardiac conduction, immune regulation, and cancer. At physiological temperature and Ca2+, TPPO--previously considered a selective TRPM5 inhibitor inactive toward TRPM4--potently activates TRPM4, revealing strong synergy among temperature, Ca2+, and ligand binding. In contrast, Necrocide-1, a necroptotic activator targeting the same binding pocket, defies this logic: it opens TRPM4 without Ca2+ but is antagonized by Ca2+. Meanwhile, the inhibitors NBA and CBA engage a nearby pocket, locking the channel in a non-conductive pre-open state. Our findings highlight that even rigid binding pockets can exhibit temperature-dependent ligand recognition, revealing hidden pharmacology and informing selective, environment-aware therapeutic strategies.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We study a crystal composed of active units governed by self-alignment and chirality. The first mechanism acts as an effective torque that aligns the particle orientation with its velocity, while the second drives individual particles along circular orbits. We find that even a weak degree of chirality, when coupled with self-alignment, induces collective motion of the entire crystal along circular trajectories in space. We refer to this phase as a circling crystal. When chirality outweigh self-alignment, the circular global motion is suppressed in favor of vortex-like regions of coordinated motion. This state is characterized by oscillating spatial velocity correlations, a power law decay of the energy spectrum, and oscillatory temporal correlations. Our findings can be tested experimentally in systems ranging from epithelial tissues to swarming robots, governed by chirality and self-alignment.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The synthesis and characterisation of thirteen sulfur-based liquid crystals are reported, based on the molecular backbone of RM734 and containing thioester linkages. Ten of these materials are new examples of ferroelectric nematogens. Phase transition temperatures are compared for systematic changes to molecular structure including the position and extent of fluorination, and the nature of lateral and terminal substituents. The new materials are compared with their ester-linked counterparts. In line with expected behaviour of the nematic phase, replacement of an ester with a thioester raised TNI, but NF phase stability upon making this change proved more variable. These findings remain in line with the general view that the formation of the NF phase is not solely governed by the magnitude of the molecular dipole moment, but able to be tuned by the interplay of steric and electronic effects endowed by different molecular fragments.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We present a controlled route to active turbulence in an active paranematic fluid, i.e., a suspension of rods that exhibit nematic order only under extensile activity. To this end, we introduce a spot of radius r with non-zero activity, embedded in an otherwise passive fluid. Due to the open boundary, defects can enter and leave the spot. As r increases starting from the nematic coherence length, we first observe paranematic order with a uniform director field, then transient + 1/2 topological defects, followed by spiral or swirling pairs of + 1/2 defects. Additional defects progressively enter until bulk active turbulence occurs. While positive and negative defect charges grow with the square of the spot radius r, the total charge only increases linearly in r. This hints to a length along the rim of the spot, comparable to the active length, so that activity can induce the director distortions needed for a defect to enter. In addition, the extensional active flow realizes active anchoring at the rim, which establishes a baseline charge of +1. Two dynamic regimes mark the progression toward bulk turbulence. The enstrophy rises sharply when the spot allows the stable circling motion of the two + 1/2 defects, and the finite-time Lyapunov exponent, characterizing the chaotic flow pattern, jumps to a non-zero value, when a third + 1/2 defect enters the spot noticeably. For large radii, both measures approach their bulk-turbulence values.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Extracellular molecules such as ions, amino acids, nucleotides, and proteins are essential mediators of intercellular communication in multicellular organisms. These diffusible factors contribute to development and homeostasis of organisms by coordinating signaling among distant cells. Despite the widespread use of fluorescent indicators for studying intracellular signaling, introducing genetically encoded indicators often complicates the control of their subcellular localization, making it difficult to distinguish intracellular from extracellular signals. Consequently, monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of diffusible molecules in the extracellular space has remained technically challenging. Here we report a versatile chemical anchoring method using lipid–polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates that immobilizes fluorescent protein (FP)–based indicators on the extracellular surface of living cells. This approach enables stable localization of FP-based indicators on hippocampal neurons in both primary cultures and in acute brain slices. Lipid–PEG–anchored indicator for potassium ion and that for glutamate allowed real-time optical monitoring of ion and neurotransmitter release from neurons during spontaneous and electrically evoked neuronal activity. This non-genetic labeling strategy provides localized, rapidly applicable, high sensitivity, stability, and reproducibility, offering a versatile platform for quantitative monitoring of extracellular signaling events near membranes of living cells in a low invasive manner.

### Polymorphisms in intron 1 of HLA-DRA differentially associate with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease and implicate involvement of complement system genes C4A and C4B

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Polymorphisms in genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region comprise the most important inherited risk factors for many autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD): both diseases are positively associated with the HLA-DR3 haplotype (<i>DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01</i>). Studies of two different populations have recently documented that T1D susceptibility in HLA-DR3 homozygous individuals is stratified by a haplotype consisting of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (‘tri-SNP’) in intron 1 of the <i>HLA-DRA</i> gene. In this study, we use a large cohort from the longitudinal ‘The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young’ (TEDDY) study to further refine the tri-SNP association with T1D and with autoantibody-defined T1D endotypes. We found that the tri-SNP association is primarily in subjects whose first-appearing T1D autoantibody is to insulin. In addition, we discovered that the tri-SNP is also associated with CD, and that the particular tri-SNP haplotype (‘101’) that is negatively associated with T1D risk is positively associated with risk for CD. The opposite effect of the tri-SNP haplotype on two DR3-associated diseases can enhance and refine current models of disease prediction based on genetic risk. Finally, we investigated possible functional differences between the individuals carrying high and low-risk tri-SNP haplotypes and found that differences in complement system genes C4A and C4B may underlie the observed divergence in disease risk.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
More than four decades ago, Gibbon and Balsam (1981) showed that the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioning in pigeons is directly related to the informativeness of the conditioning stimulus (CS) about the unconditioned stimulus (US), where informativeness is defined as the ratio of the US-US interval (<i>C</i>) to the CS-US interval (<i>T</i>). However, the evidence for this relationship in other species has been equivocal. Here, we describe an experiment that measured the acquisition of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in 14 groups of rats trained with different <i>C</i>/<i>T</i> ratios (ranging from 1.5 to 300) to establish how learning is related to informativeness. We show that the number of trials required for rats to start responding to the CS is determined by the <i>C</i>/<i>T</i> ratio, and the specific scalar relationship between the rate of learning and informativeness is similar to that previously obtained with pigeons. We also found that the response rate after extended conditioning is strongly related to <i>T</i>, with the terminal CS response rate being a scalar function of the CS reinforcement rate (1 <i>/T</i>). Moreover, this same scalar relationship extended to the rats’ response rates during the inter-trial interval, which was directly proportional to the overall rate of reinforcement in the context (1 <i>/C</i>). The findings establish that animals encode rates of reinforcement, and that conditioning is directly related to how much information the CS provides about the US. The consistency of these observations across species, captured by a simple regression function, suggests a universal model of conditioning.

### Superstable Geometry in Triadic Percolation

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Triadic percolation turns bond percolation into a dynamical problem governed by an effective one-dimensional unimodal map. We show that the geometry of superstable cycles provides a direct, map-agnostic probe of local nonlinearity: specifically, the distance from the map's maximum to a distinguished next-to-maximum point on the attracting $2^n$-cycle (which coincides with a preimage of the maximum at $2^n$-superstability) scales as $|Δp|^γ$ with $γ= 1/z$, where $z$ is the nonflat order of the maximum. This prediction is verified across canonical unimodal families and heterogeneous triadic ensembles, with Lyapunov spectra corroborating the one-dimensional reduction. A derivative condition on the activation kernel fixes the local nonlinearity order $z$ (and thus, under standard unimodal-map hypotheses, the associated $z$-logistic universality class) and gives conditions under which $z>2$ can be realized. The diagnostic operates directly on orbit data under standard regularity assumptions, providing a practical tool to classify universality in higher-order networks.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Mesenchymal cell migration starts with the protrusion of the cells leading edge, enabled by the branching growth of the actin network. Two crucial molecular players in protrusion are actin filaments and the Arp2/3 protein complex, the branching agent. Traditionally, protrusion models are intuited from several perturbative experiments. Recent multiplex microscopy imaging data promise to drastically change this paradigm by providing measurements of naturally fluctuating densities of key proteins at the leading edge of unperturbed cells. We report the first attempt to reconstruct the mechanistic protrusion model from such data. We analyze fluctuations of F-actin and Arp2/3 densities and cell edge velocity using phase space and regression analysis to reconstruct linearized stochastic actin-Arp2/3-velocity coupled dynamics. We then build a nonlinear partial differential equation model of these dynamics based on previous knowledge of this system and parsimony. The resulting model recovers the rates of reactions and mechanical and transport processes in the lamellipodium from a single non-perturbative experiment. The model posits that the only essential nonlinearities in the lamellipodial dynamics stem from the retrograde flow of F-actin. The model suggests that the protrusion is dominated by a damped oscillatory cycle resulting from a combination of positive feedback from Arp2/3 to protrusion velocity and negative feedback from F-actin to the velocity.  Significance statementTraditionally, models of intracellular mechanochemistry are intuited from perturbative experiments. Multiplex microscopy imaging changes this by providing measurements of naturally fluctuating densities of key proteins in unperturbed cells. We use such data to reconstruct a mechanistic model of cell leading edge. We build equations for actin system and edge velocity using data, previous knowledge and parsimony. The resulting model recovers the rates of reactions and mechanical and transport processes at the leading edge. The model suggests that the protrusion is dominated by a damped oscillatory cycle resulting from a combination of positive feedback from Arp2/3 to protrusion velocity and negative feedback from F-actin to the velocity.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Cdc48 (p97 or VCP in metazoans) targets polyubiquitin to selectively disassemble and degrade proteins. Cdc48 is believed to move along the ubiquitin chain towards linked proteins, but this has not been directly observed. By following single molecules in time, we find that the polypeptide branch points of ubiquitin chains are repeatedly inserted and rejected from the Cdc48 pore in ATP-driven manner, in bursts lasting up to seconds. This non-processive mode either ends by terminal substrate rejection, or advances to processive action, which drives ubiquitin unfolding in two steps, branch point translocation, and the extrusion of ubiquitin and linked protein as polypeptide loops in trans. Final retrograde movement can bring polypeptide segments back to cis. Our results establish the dynamics of ubiquitin chain handling by Cdc48, reveal key hallmarks of kinetic proofreading. We speculate that Cdc48 translocation may play a role in ubiquitin chain selection.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
RNA utilizes three-dimensional structure in addition to sequence to carry out diverse functions in gene expression and disease. Much like well-folded proteins, RNAs adopt specific three-dimensional structures to carry out their function. Yet comparatively few RNA structures have been solved by atomic resolution structural techniques, in part because unlike structured proteins, RNAs fold into heterogeneous ensembles of interconverting structures that pose a challenge for high-resolution structure probing methods. In this work, we introduce RNAnneal as a method for RNA structural ensemble prediction that seamlessly integrates generative deep learning with statistical physics and molecular dynamics modeling. Given the primary sequence, RNAnneal uses ab inito (i.e., first principles) modeling to sample an ensemble of 3D structures, which, in turn, are used to train an ensemble of unsupervised deep learning models. The RNAnneal score, representing the consensus of the deep learning models, is then used to evaluate the 3D structures. We evaluated RNAnneal structures against 16 experimentally-resolved conformations (ERCs) of riboswitch RNAs and found that pseudoknot-free (PK-free) ERCs were well-reproduced by RNAnneal, with clear avenues for improving performance even on PK-comprising structures. Furthermore, we found that the RNAnneal score outperforms the Rosetta score and a state-of-the-art RNA forcefield on the task of classifying ERCs from decoys. We then introduce the interaction entropy as a measure of conformational heterogeneity within an ensemble and use it to assess our predictions. RNAnneal thus provides a generalizable framework for predicting RNA structural ensembles that will accelerate RNA-targeted drug discovery and the design of functional RNA molecules.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Mitochondria serve as central hubs for Ca2+ signaling, which is critical for metabolism, intercellular communication, and cell fate determination. Mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is maintained through tightly coordinated influx and efflux processes, with NCLX long recognized as the primary Ca2+ extruder operating via Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Despite its physiological significance, the molecular basis of NCLX function has remained unclear. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of rat NCLX in cytosolic-facing occluded and open states. The central transmembrane (TM) module of NCLX comprises 10 helices organized into two structurally similar halves with inverted orientations. Two characteristic -repeats form a central ion-binding pocket, while peripheral TMs 1 and 6 are loosely associated with the core, likely mediating alternative access to the binding site. These structural features closely resemble those of NCXs, revealing a conserved mechanism underlying ion exchange. While NCLX retains the canonical Ca2+-binding site, it lacks several key Na+-binding residues found in NCXs, suggesting it functions as a non-selective cation/Ca2+ exchanger. Consistent with this, cell-based Ca2+ uptake assays show that NCLX mediates slower Ca2+ exchange than NCX and can utilize Na+, K+, Li+, and potentially protons as counterions. Leveraging the structural symmetry of NCLX and its bidirectional exchange capability, we propose a model for the matrix-facing state and an alternating-access mechanism in which the sliding-door motions of TMs 1 and 6 enable ion access from cytosolic and matrix sides, analogous to NCX. These findings provide a structural and mechanistic framework for understanding mitochondrial NCLX function.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is a respiratory chain enzyme found in pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae, and is essential for energy metabolism by generating a transmembrane Na+ gradient that drives ATP synthesis and flagellar motility. Because the molecular structure of Na+-NQR is unrelated to the corresponding mitochondrial H-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (respiratory complex I), it is a promising antibiotic target. Although it has been shown that Na+ pumping is mediated by an alternating-access conformational change in the NqrD/E subunits, coupled to redox switching of a cofactor, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the conformational transition, including the free-energy profile and the rate-limiting steps, remain unclear. Here, we construct redox-state-dependent Markov state models (MSMs) from extensive molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories in the oxidized and reduced states to quantify the conformational free-energy landscapes and primary transition pathway. To accelerate conformational sampling, MD simulations are initiated from diverse NqrD/E conformations generated by AlphaFold. Our analysis clarifies how the NqrD/E conformation is regulated by the redox state and by Na+ binding to achieve Na+ translocation. This study provides a quantitative framework for understanding ion-pumping mechanisms of redox-driven membrane proteins.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Functional specialization in continuous systems requires balancing adaptation to environmental stress with the preservation of encoded information. Yet, the physical constraints governing how living systems reconcile selective information retention with energetic structural reorganization remain unclear-a trade-off that may offer transferable design rules for adaptive computing. Here we present a unified framework that connects cellular specialization to adaptive machine learning through principles of nonequilibrium optimization. We find that asymmetric fluctuations in key parameters act as tunable drives that, when phase-aligned, are rectified into durable functional specialization. Biologically, we show that in adipose mesenchymal cells, transient nutrient deficits trigger cytosolic pH fluctuations. These oscillations, regulated by the ATP12A proton pump, modulate nuclear compartment dynamics to coordinate mitochondrial specialization and lock in epigenetic memory for phenotype persistence. Notably, modulating ATP12A amplifies these drives, enhancing functional specialization and metabolic homeostasis in disease models. Computationally, we formalize analogous principles using a compositional framework based on operadic algebra, where structural updates act as a topological ratchet converting drive fluctuations into persistent architectures. This reveals a learning regime where gains in predictive information are accompanied by auditable residual costs for non-predictive states and reorganization. As a proof of concept, we deploy a self-organizing machine learning system that discovers latent hierarchy and reconstructs data through adaptive compartment dynamics. We show that internal organization fluctuations increase with residuals, an information-processing ledger guiding adaptive computation. Across both domains, local organization gains are directionally linked to dissipation proxies (pH variance in vivo and residuals in silico), consistent with operation under shared constraints. Overall, this work identifies asymmetric-drive rectification as a fundamental mechanism of adaptive specialization, providing thermodynamically informed design rules for both bioengineering and adaptive AI.  One-Sentence SummaryAsymmetric-drive rectification is a fundamental mechanism by which cells and adaptive computational systems convert internal stress into structural memory, encoding functional specialization

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) are tetrameric ER Ca2+ channels that shape intracellular Ca2+ signaling in response to IP3, regulating many physiological processes. The structural basis for subtype-specific regulation of three subtypes (IP3R-1-3) remains incompletely understood, due to the lack of IP3R-2 structures. Here, we determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human IP3R-2 in distinct conformations with and without IP3, Ca2+, and ATP. These structures define the conformational ensembles adopted by IP3R-2 and delineate ligand-binding interactions. Comparison with rat IP3R-1 and human IP3R-3 highlights shared architectural features and isoform-specific differences that underlie subtype-specific functional properties. We also resolved structures of IP3R-2 clusters, providing insight into mechanisms of ligand-dependent clustering. Together, these findings establish a structural framework for human IP3R-2, linking ligand recognition to conformational transitions and interchannel interfaces, and illuminate how subtype-specific features and clustering may shape cellular Ca2+ signaling.
