### Emergent hydrodynamic synchronization between microbeads labelingbacterial flagellar motors

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon observed across a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Even under the low-Reynolds-number conditions that govern microbial motility, synchronization of rhythmic processes is considered essential for diverse activities ranging from single cells to populations, yet experimental evidence remains scarce. Here, we performed rotation measurements of microbeads attached to two truncated bacterial flagella and observed the emergence of phase synchronization between these nanoscale active motors. The resulting intermittent in-phase synchronization was analyzed using a hydrodynamic model incorporating elastic deformation of the flagella, showing that stronger hydrodynamic coupling promotes more stable phase-locking. This study experimentally demonstrates fluid-mediated biological synchronization using bacterial rotary machinery, deepening our understanding of the physical principles underlying rhythmic phenomena and self-organization in living systems.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The protein vinculin mediates actin-myosin-dependent adhesion strength to regulate force transmission at cellular adhesions. The precise distribution of forces sensed by vinculin that regulates downstream cellular processes remains unclear. To determine vinculin tension in multiple cell types, a FRET-based tension-sensitive module was knocked into the vinculin locus of human induced pluripotent stem cells. Measurements of vinculin tension and adhesion spatial distributions were used to create mechanical profiles that identify cellular origin and differentially correlate to cell shape characteristics.

Protein-DNA co-condensates where protein and DNA condensates co-localize, formed through liquid-liquid phase separation, play critical roles in gene expression, cancer and developmental defects. Recent experimental studies have revealed the impact of mechanical stress on these co-condensates, but their dynamic processes and microscopic structures remain poorly characterized. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the nanoscale natures of FUS and DNA co-condensation under DNA stretching.

### Solvothermal vapor annealing and environmental control setup with adjustable magnetic field module for GISAXS studies
**Source:** arXiv
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Authors:** Christian Kjeldbjerg, Bo Jakobsen, Miriam Varón, Kim Lefmann, Cathrine Frandsen, Dorthe Posselt

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
A compact, modular environmental control and solvothermal vapor annealing chamber designed for maintaining a controlled atmosphere with regard to solvent humidity and temperature is presented. The setup allows ex situ and in situ grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) investigations of thin film self-assembly and reorganization. Its modular slotting system enables stable reconfiguration, including the integration of an adjustable magnetic field module. The temperature is maintained via a water-based heating and cooling loop supplemented by resistive elements, and the solvent vapor environment is regulated using a commercial controlled mixing and evaporation unit. The performance of the setup is validated through measurements of fill and quench times together with magnetic field mapping with Gauss meter measurements and finite element simulations. Further, the versatility of the setup is demonstrated with four research examples using the chamber for solvothermal vapor annealing of block copolymer thin films together with lab-based ex situ and in situ GISAXS measurements. The portable new design offers robust environmental control and flexibility for advanced thin film investigations both in the lab and at large scale facilities. The design can be adapted for grazing incidence small-angle neutron scattering, GISANS.

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Objective. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a fundamental mechanism underlying learning and memory, yet its investigation at the network level in vitro remains challenging, particularly when optogenetic stimulation is used. The objective of this work is to develop a robust experimental and analytical framework for inducing and quantifying optogenetically driven LTP in neuronal cultures recorded with microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Approach. We first systematically investigate the effect of widefield optogenetic stimulation frequency on evoked neuronal activity, to identify a test-stimulus that reliably probes network responses without inducing activity modulation. By analyzing spike-rate dynamics during repeated stimulation, we characterize frequency-dependent response adaptation consistent with Channelrhodopsin-2 photocycle kinetics. Based on these results, an optimized low-frequency test-stimulus is selected and combined with a spatially confined tetanic optogenetic stimulation to induce LTP. Network responses are quantified using post-stimulus time histograms and a normalized efficacy metric, enabling electrode-wise and network-level analysis of plasticity. Main results. Low-frequency optical stimulation (<= 0.2 Hz) preserves stable evoked responses, whereas higher frequencies induce a pronounced sigmoid-like decay in firing rate. Following tetanic stimulation, a subset of electrodes exhibits robust and long-lasting potentiation, persisting for several hours. Significance. This work provides a systematic methodology for studying activity-dependent plasticity in optogenetically driven neuronal networks.

### Early stages of collective cell invasion: Biomechanics
**Source:** arXiv

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The early stages of the collective invasion may occur by single mesenchymal cells or hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal cell groups that detach from cancerous tissue. Tumors may also emit invading protrusions of epithelial cells, which could be led (or not) by a basal cell. Here we devise a fractional step cellular Potts model comprising passive and active cells able to describe these different types of collective invasion before cells start proliferating. Durotaxis and active forces have different symmetry properties and are included in different half steps of the fractional step method. Compared with a single step method, fractional step produces more realistic cellular invasion scenarios with little extra computational effort. Biochemical mechanisms that determine how cells acquire their different phenotypes and cellular proliferation will be incorporated to the model in future publications.

### High-speed atomic force microscopy reveals a surface-catalyzed elongation mechanism of the fungal functional amyloid hydrophobin RolA

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Hydrophobins are functional amyloids conserved in filamentous fungi. They act as a protective coat in the fibrous form, called rodlet. Rodlets further assemble to form dense films where they are bundled and densely aligned, contributing to the hydrophobicity of the mycelium surface. The mechanism of this dense film formation is completely unknown. Here, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to directly observe the structural dynamics of rodlet bundling and subsequent film formation by hydrophobin RolA from the industrial fungus
                    
                      Aspergillus
                      oryzae
                    
                    at a single-fibril level, and we revealed the film-formation mechanism. Rodlet elongation occurred at both ends and was discontinuous, alternating between periods when rodlets could elongate (growth state) and could not elongate (pause state). This suggests an equilibrium of two distinct structural states at the rodlet ends. We also identified a pathway, termed “surface-catalyzed elongation,” in which elongation is promoted by lateral interactions between bundled rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation decreased the energy barrier of both structural switching between growth and pause states and elongation at rodlet ends, doubling the elongation rate in bundled rodlets. The rodlet surface could be considered as a catalyst for the elongation of neighboring rodlets. Surface-catalyzed elongation could contribute to rodlet bundling, whereby rodlets tend to form oriented domain structures; our Monte Carlo simulations confirmed this. The concept we propose here provides a clear explanation of the mechanism by which rodlets form a dense coat on the cell surface.

### Transition from traveling fronts to diffusion-limited growth in expanding populations
**Source:** arXiv
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Authors:** Louis Brezin, Kyle J. Shaffer, Kirill S. Korolev
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11540v1
<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Reaction-diffusion equations describe various spatially extended processes that unfold as traveling fronts moving at constant velocity. We introduce and solve analytically a model that, besides such fronts, supports solutions advancing as the square root of time. These sublinear fronts preserve an invariant shape, with an effective diffusion constant that diverges at the transition to linear spreading. The model applies to dense cellular aggregates of nonmotile cells consuming a diffusible nutrient. The sublinear spread results from biomass redistribution slowing due to nutrient depletion, a phenomenon supported experimentally but often neglected. Our results provide a potential explanation for the linear rather than quadratic increase of colony area with time, which has been observed for many microbes.

### Nonmonotonic Magnetic Friction from Collective Rotor Dynamics
**Source:** arXiv
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Authors:** Hongri Gu, Anton Lüders, Clemens Bechinger
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11526v1
<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Amontons' law postulates a monotonic relationship between frictional force and the normal load applied to a sliding contact. This empirical rule, however, fails in systems where internal degrees of freedom - such as structural or electronic order - play a central role. Here, we demonstrate that friction can emerge entirely from magnetically driven configurational dynamics in the absence of physical contact. Using a two-dimensional array of rotatable magnetic dipoles sliding over a commensurate magnetic substrate, we observe a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of friction on the interlayer separation, and thus on the effective load. The friction peaks at an intermediate distance where competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions induce dynamical frustration and hysteretic torque cycles during sliding. Molecular dynamics simulations and a simplified two-sublattice model confirm that energy dissipation is governed by collective magnetic reorientations and their hysteresis. Our results establish the occurrence of sliding-induced changes in collective magnetic order, which has a strong impact on friction, and thus open new possibilities for contactless friction control, magnetic sensing, and the design of reconfigurable, wear-free frictional interfaces and metamaterials.

### Alternative probe chemistries for single-molecule analysis of long non-coding RNA

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Single-molecule microscopy has been widely used to study the structure and dynamics of RNA, but extension to larger systems such as long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has proven challenging. The length and complex nature of lncRNA limit the techniques that can be readily used to study these aspects, but methods such as single-molecule kinetic analysis of RNA transient structure (SiM-KARTS), where the binding of a short, complementary oligonucleotide probe is used to determine accessibility of a specific region of the RNA, are promising. However, adapting SiM-KARTS to systems as complex as lncRNA requires careful optimization of experimental variables that have not been thoroughly explored. In this work, SiM-KARTS, thermal denaturation experiments, and circular dichroism spectroscopy were used to analyze the binding behaviors of probes with alternative backbone chemistries, specifically DNA with locked nucleic acid residues incorporated and morpholinos. A segment of lncRNA that enabled control over the accessibility of the target sequence was used as a model. We show that optimizing probe backbone chemistry can allow for a more precise distinction between different structures of the target RNA, and for fine-tuning of probe binding stability without the structural impacts that other variables such as ionic concentration may have. These results provide design principles for the application of SiM-KARTS to target RNAs of increased complexity such as lncRNA.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We report on recent methodological advances at the Life Science X-ray Scattering (LiX) beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) to support small-angle X-ray scattering experiments on skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues. These experiments have been routinely performed at the BioCAT beamline of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) over the past two decades to measure sarcomeric protein organization within healthy and diseased muscle tissues and provide direct molecular evidence for their functional roles and dynamics. Many recent advances in our understanding of sarcomeric proteins relied on diffraction data and include, as examples, MyBP-C, crossbridge SRX/DRX states, and titin. With LiX now available for muscle experimentation, more muscle users can be supported which will speed up research of sarcomeric proteins, muscle biomechanics, and skeletal and cardiac myopathies. LiX explicitly focuses on high-throughput muscle diffraction with rapid sample turnover and semi-automated data processing. These operations have been tested and validated on skeletal and cardiac tissues sourced from both humans and multiple animal models including pig, rat, mouse, and zebrafish.

### Seeing the chemistry of biomolecular condensates: in situ mapping of composition and water content

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Biomolecular condensates are cellular organelles that form via liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids. The functional role of condensates is tightly coupled to their material properties such as viscosity and hydrophobicity, which serve as phenomenological markers of cellular state in health and disease. These properties depend critically on condensate composition and water content. However, available approaches to determine condensate composition typically rely on invasive procedures that can disrupt or destroy the tested sample. Here, we introduce Raman spectroscopy coupled with spectral phasor analysis as an in situ, label-free approach to resolve the chemical profile and molecular concentrations within aqueous polymer solutions and within the dense and dilute phases of biomolecular condensate systems. In addition to quantifying the protein and water volume fractions, our method yields a precise readout of client molecule partitioning inside condensates. Across a wide range of condensate systems, we find that the dense phase remains overwhelmingly water-rich, even in condensates that exhibit low apparent dielectric constants. By explicitly accounting for protein backbone contributions to the Raman spectrum, we assess the contribution of "solid-like" hydrogen-bonded water resulting from protein hydration and find that the overwhelming majority of water molecules within condensates largely retain bulk "liquid-like" vibrational properties. Finally, by combining Raman-based compositional analysis with environment-sensitive fluorescent probes, we investigate the microscopic determinants of condensate hydrophobicity. We show that condensate hydrophobicity emerges from a combined contribution of the macromolecular structural features and water partitioning inside condensates, rather than from water content or hydrogen bonding alone.

### Protein-free membrane fusion: a refined view of the delicate fusogenic properties of calcium

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
In the late 20th century, calcium took on the identity of an independent fusogen, when it was found to induce fusion of anionic large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), yet its ability to drive fusion in cell-sized membranes remains poorly understood. Here, we directly quantify calcium-mediated fusion of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) using a microfluidic trapping platform combined with confocal microscopy, enabling simultaneous measurement of lipid mixing, content mixing, and fusion outcomes across hundreds of single vesicles. We systematically map fusion efficiency as a function of calcium concentration, membrane composition, and mechanically imposed tension. We find that calcium-induced fusion of GUVs in the absence of proteins is remarkably fickle and composition-sensitive, as the vesicles need to be sufficiently instable to allow the opening of the fusion pore, yet stable enough to prevent bursting and collapse. Negatively charged GUVs containing high fractions of DOPE exhibit the highest fusogenic responsiveness, whereas other compositions undergo extensive lipid mixing without pore formation. Increasing membrane tension can shift this balance and promote full fusion, revealing a narrow parameter space in which calcium acts as an effective protein-free fusogen for cell-sized membranes. These findings clarify longstanding discrepancies between LUV- and GUV-based calcium fusion assays and provide quantitative design rules for employing calcium as a fusogen in synthetic biology and membrane-reconstitution studies, where controlled membrane growth, vesicle-vesicle fusion, and module integration are central to building and sustaining artificial cells.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Turbulence, left unforced, evolves under its own dynamics, invading surrounding quiescent fluid as it decays. A ubiquitous and familiar phenomenon, this fundamental aspect of turbulence has resisted the marriage of principled theory and experiment with no universal law yet capturing its evolution. Conventional flow chamber experiments have been hampered by boundary effects or strong mean flows that obscure the intrinsic dynamics of relaxation to quiescence. To circumvent these limitations, we create a spatially localized blob of turbulence using eight converging vortex generators focused at the center of a water tank, and observe its decay and expansion over decades in time using particle image velocimetry with logarithmic time sampling. The blob initially expands and decays until it reaches the walls of the tank and eventually transitions to a second regime of approximately spatially uniform decay. We interpret the turbulent dynamics as an interplay of nonlinear diffusion with associated steep fronts separating the turbulent and quiescent regions, and nonlinear decay, as described by the Kolmogorov–Barenblatt equation. We find direct evidence for this model within the expansion phase and decay phases of our turbulent blob and use it to account for the detailed behavior we observe. Our work provides a detailed spatially resolved narrative for the behavior of turbulence once the forcing is removed, and demonstrates unexpectedly that the turbulent cascade leaves an indelible footprint far into the decay process.

### Conformational dynamics at the pre-miR-377 Dicer site governs selective small-molecule recognition

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Small molecules that target precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) offer a strategy to modulate microRNA biogenesis, but rational design is limited by the intrinsic conformational dynamics of RNA. Here, we combine site-specific nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to define the conformational ensemble of pre-miR-377 and its recognition by the small-molecule binder C1. Our data reveals that the Dicer cleavage site contains a dynamic adenosine bulge in which U25 shuffles between A3 and A4 with a ~9:1 population ratio, generating two interconverting RNA triple structures. NMR-informed MD and binding simulations show that C1 engages this dynamic region through a pathway-dependent mechanism that favors minor-groove entry, stabilizes intermediate, partially reorganized Dicer-site conformations, and redistributes the conformational ensemble away from processing-competent states. A conformationally locked mutant abolishes binding, indicating that recognition depends on bulge-enabled RNA dynamics rather than a single static structure. These results define the structural and dynamic basis of small-molecule recognition at the pre-miR-377 Dicer site and highlight the importance of RNA conformational ensembles in RNA-targeted drug discovery.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The Arf GTPases are eukaryotic signaling proteins implicated in trafficking, motility and membrane remodeling. They must undergo a massive conformational transition in the switch between their inactive, GDP-bound form and their GTP-bound form, competent for downstream signaling. The mechanism of their GDP-to-GTP nucleotide switch implicates a functional molten globule (MG) ensemble. Access to this ensemble and apparent spontaneous switching is modulated by residues in the C-terminal half of the different Arf homologs through a “back-to-front” allosteric pathway.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
One fundamental yet open question is how eukaryotic chromosomes fold into segregated territories, a process essential for gene transcription and cell fate. Through analyzing multiple sequencing- and imaging-based datasets, we identify long-range chromosomal skeleton loop structures that span over 100 Mb, extending beyond the reach of several existing DNA loop models. Further epigenetic and spatial density analyses point to assembly formation independent of major nuclear structures. Some long-range loops share a subset of genomic loci, which serve as nucleation centers and drive loop clustering. These complexes are highly stable, as shown by live-cell imaging with sequence-specific fluorescent labeling, and biophysical model analyses reveal a multivalent binding mechanism. Our findings suggest a redundant, distributed cluster mechanism that ensures robustness across cell types and against mutations, guiding both chromosome compaction and the formation of smaller-scale chromosomal structures.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is primarily of adult-onset and caused by pathogenic variants in <i>PKD1</i> or <i>PKD2</i>. Yet, disease expression is highly variable and includes very early-onset PKD presentations in utero or infancy. In animal models, the RNA-binding molecule Bicc1 has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PKD. To study the interaction between BICC1, PKD1, and PKD2, we combined biochemical approaches, knockout studies in mice and <i>Xenopus,</i> genetic engineered human kidney cells carrying <i>BICC1</i> variants, as well as genetic studies in a large ADPKD cohort. We first demonstrated that BICC1 physically binds to the proteins Polycystin-1 and -2 encoded by <i>PKD1</i> and <i>PKD2</i> via distinct protein domains. Furthermore, PKD was aggravated in loss-of-function studies in <i>Xenopus</i> and mouse models, resulting in more severe disease when <i>Bicc1</i> was depleted in conjunction with <i>Pkd1 or Pkd2</i>. Finally, in a large human patient cohort, we identified a sibling pair with a homozygous <i>BICC1</i> variant and patients with very early onset PKD (VEO-PKD) that exhibited compound heterozygosity of <i>BICC1</i> in conjunction with <i>PKD1 and PKD2</i> variants. Genome editing demonstrated that these <i>BICC1</i> variants were hypomorphic in nature and impacted disease-relevant signaling pathways. These findings support the hypothesis that BICC1 cooperates functionally with PKD1 and PKD2, and that <i>BICC1</i> variants may aggravate PKD severity, highlighting RNA metabolism as an important new concept for disease modification in ADPKD.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Genomes are organized into chromatin loops through cohesin-mediated extrusion, with CTCF acting as a polar boundary element. As cohesin approaches CTCF at kilobase-per-second speeds, it must rapidly choose whether to stall or bypass. How CTCF encodes this probabilistic decision within a brief encounter window has remained unclear. Here we show that CTCF governs this probabilistic outcome by rapidly sampling a dynamic ensemble of conformations generated by spontaneous rearrangements of its DNA-binding zinc fingers. This ensemble is tuned by DNA sequence, CpG methylation, nearby nucleosomes, and the cohesin regulator PDS5A before cohesin engagement. Upon cohesin binding, PDS5A enhances loop-anchor mechanical stability, reinforcing orientation-dependent boundaries. These findings establish conformational ensemble tuning, rather than static occupancy, as a regulatory principle linking base pair-scale motions to megabase-scale genome organization.

### When lipids embrace RNA: pH-driven dynamics and mechanisms of LNP-mediated siRNA delivery

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We present a comprehensive analysis of an efficient lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation that exhibits strong nucleic-acid delivery and potent inhibition of targeted RNAs. Using a combination of coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we characterized the pH-dependent structure of both unloaded and RNA-loaded LNPs, elucidated the mechanism of RNA encapsulation, and used these models to propose a plausible mechanism of endosomal escape. Consistent with prior experimental and computational studies, our simulations reproduce an inverted-hexagonal-type morphology in RNA-loaded LNPs, in which a hydrated core provides a polar environment suitable for accommodating RNA, whose charge is neutralized mainly by ionizable lipids that remain protonated near the RNA even at high pH, thereby bridging the RNA with the surrounding lipid environment. This structural picture is consistently observed across our multiscale simulations, with smaller self-assembled LNP mimetics reproducing the same local organization at both coarse-grained and atomistic resolution. A potential mechanism of endosomal escape emerges spontaneously from the simulations, involving stalk formation between the LNP and the endosomal membrane, followed by the opening of a water-filled pore that permits slow RNA diffusion, in line with the low efficiency and slow kinetics reported for endosomal escape. The rate-limiting step of endosomal escape arises from persistent electrostatic coupling between RNA and protonated ionizable lipids maintained by the immediate RNA-lipid environment, hindering cargo disengagement even after pore formation. This delayed release is consistent with the experimentally observed time-dependent inhibitory activity of the loaded LNP. Together, these results highlight the importance of local pKa and protonation effects near the RNA, which are not captured by global apparent pKa measurements.

### A physics-informed data-driven framework for modeling hyperelastic materials with progressive damage and failure
**Source:** arXiv

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
This work presents a two-stage physics-informed, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for hyperelastic soft materials undergoing progressive damage and failure. The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data.

### How cross-disciplinary science can describe living matter

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Experience shows that disciplinary science cannot describe life without contradictions. We show that one of the fundamental reasons is the disciplinarity itself: the disciplines deal with a limited set of quantities. This way some 'outlaw' quantities are not measured and the discipline does not have laws about them. All laws of science are based on approximations and the approximations must be different for inanimate and life sciences. Studying ions is special because ions belong simultaneously to thermodynamics and electricity, but neither of those disciplines alone can describe biological processes. One needs a cross-disciplinary discussion and maybe a new scientific discipline. We provide a method for handling the different interaction speeds characterizing the ion transport. Electrolytes in living matter introduce further peculiarities with their closed volumes, internal structure, and slow processes. Their meticulous analysis led to the appropriate approximations, leading to the correct scientific description. As a success story, the cross-disciplinary theory of neuronal operation has been developed.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Reciprocity is a fundamental symmetry present in many natural phenomena and engineered systems. Distinct situations where this symmetry is broken are typically grouped under the umbrella term "nonreciprocity", colloquially defined by: the action of A on B $\neq$ the action of B on A. In this review, we elucidate what nonreciprocity is by providing an introduction to its most salient classes: nonvariational dynamics, violations of Newton's third law, broken detailed balance, nonreciprocal responses and nonreciprocity of arbitrary linear operators. Next, we point out where to find these manifestations of non-reciprocity, from ensembles of particles with field mediated interactions to synthetic neural networks and open quantum systems. Given this breadth of contexts and the lack of an all-encompassing definition, it makes it all the more intriguing that some general conclusions can be gathered, when distinct definitions of nonreciprocity overlap. We explore what these universal consequences are with a special emphasis on collective phenomena that arise in nonreciprocal many-body systems. The topics covered include nonreciprocal phase transitions and non-normal amplification of noise and perturbations. We conclude with some open questions.

### Reentrance in a Hamiltonian flocking model

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The clustering of self-motile and repulsive particles, so-called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), is one of the clearest signatures of active physics. Typically, increasing the amplitude of self-motility increases the degree of clustering, however for high enough self-motility the homogeneous phase is reentered. Here, we report that such reentrance naturally emerges in a Hamiltonian (conservative) model known to recapitulate properties of (active) bird flocks, and exhibits clustering behaviour reminiscent of MIPS. We numerically demonstrate the reentrance of the homogeneous phase and identify the underlying mechanism as a competition between the amplitude of a spin-velocity coupled drive and mobility-limited kinetic frustration. Specifically, we reveal that strong spin-velocity coupling suppresses transverse diffusion, thereby leading the system into an arrest that closes the window for phase separation. Overall, our work offers a Hamiltonian, conservative, bridge between reentrant physics across equilibrium and non-equilibrium materials.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Lyotropic liquid crystals can display rich phase behaviour and self-organisation, yet the physical principles underlying their self-assembly into large scale patterns remains understudied. Here, we combine theory, simulations and experiments on Sunset Yellow-water chromonic mixtures to show that such materials spontaneously phase separate, even without assuming any underlying microscopic attraction between the molecular species. In our minimal model, demixing depends solely on the Onsager-like coupling between local nematogen density and orientational order. If such a coupling is sufficiently strong, nematic defects trigger the nucleation of isotropic droplets, which then coalesce due to elastic or interfacial tensions. We further show that strong anchoring of the director field at the interface arrests this coarsening process, resulting in a stable microphase separated lamellar pattern. This self-assembled smectic phase has striking and unusual features, including spontaneous undulations, heterogeneous layer spacing, long-lived glassy defect patterns and lamellar onions. Our results identify orientational-density coupling and elastocapillarity as fundamental mechanisms to guide self-assembly in lyotropic and chromonic liquid crystals.

Biological machines like molecular motors and enzymes operate in dynamic cycles representable as stochastic flows on networks. Current stochastic dynamics describes such flows on fixed networks. Here, we develop a scalable approach to network design in which local transition rates can be systematically varied to achieve global dynamical objectives. It is based on the fluctuation-response duality in the recent Caliber Force Theory -- a path-entropy variational formalism for nonequilibria. This approach scales efficiently with network complexity and gives new insights, for example revealing the transition from timing- to branching-dominated fluctuations in a kinesin motor model.

Industrial polymeric materials often rely on antioxidants to achieve long-term reliability. Previous studies have frequently discussed the stabilization effect in the presence of macroscopic additive migration. However, the micro- to meso-scale coupling between polymer dynamics and antioxidant molecular dynamics remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we extend a polymer dynamics simulation framework that can account for oxidative aging. We also update the model so that it can explicitly incorporate antioxidant molecules into the simulation. As a result, the framework enables us to quantify how molecular architecture of antioxidants affects oxidation kinetics, which has previously been inferred only indirectly from apparent changes in reaction rates. It also allows us to evaluate the effects of antioxidant concentration and molecular architecture on the spatial heterogeneity of oxidative aging.

### Abnormal calcium release and delayed afterdepolarizations: A comparison of two mathematical models for human ventricular myocytes

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<p>by Navneet Roshan, Rahul Pandit</p>  Focal arrhythmias, which arise from delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), are observed in various pathophysiological heart conditions; these can lead to sudden cardiac death. A clear understanding of the interplay of electrophysiological factors of cardiac myocytes, which lead to DADs, can suggest pharmacological targets that can eliminate DAD-induced arrhythmias. Therefore, we carry out multiscale investigations of two mathematical models for human-ventricular myocytes, namely, the ten Tusscher-Panfilov TP06 model and the HuVEC15 model of Himeno, et al., at the levels of single myocytes, one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) tissue, and anatomically realistic bi-ventricular domains. We demonstrate that the Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) pump uptake rate and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak through the ryanodine-receptor (RyR) channel impact this transition significantly. We show that the frequencies and amplitudes of the DADs are key features that can be used to classify them into three types, at the single-myocyte level. By carrying out detailed parameter-sensitivity analyses, we identify the electrophysiological parameters, in the myocyte models, that most affect these key features. We then obtain stability (or phase) diagrams that show the regions of parameter space in which different types of DADs occur. By comparing differences in model compartmentalizations, we show that these structural features can significantly influence both the occurrence and the types of DADs. We demonstrate in the TP06 model, the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger can also play a protective role in the elimination of DADs, and the presence of late calcium releases can enhance this effect. We present representative tissue simulations of the spatiotemporal evolution of waves of electrical activation, in these models, to illustrate how arrhythmogenic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) emerge from patches of DAD cells, when we pace the tissue.

<p>by Akshay Uttarkar, Vidya Niranjan, Amit Saxena, Vinay Kumar</p> Background and Objective <p>Protein folding, and especially the conformational sampling of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), remains a formidable challenge for classical computation. We introduce QuPepFold, a modular Python package designed to democratize hybrid quantum–classical simulations of peptide folding, with the specific aim of enabling exploration of IDR ensembles for therapeutic targeting.</p> Methods <p>We compute ground-state energies using a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) that has been tuned with a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) objective. This CVaR approach focuses on the lowest-energy measurement results, which speeds convergence and helps the algorithm cope with noise. The software provides an interface suitable for biologists and is independent of any particular quantum hardware; it currently runs on Qiskit Aer, Braket’s tensor-network simulator, and IonQ’s Aria-1 device through the Amazon Braket service.</p> Results <p>In tests on short peptides up to ten amino acids long, the CVaR-optimized VQE reached the ground state roughly 30 percent faster than a standard VQE based on expectation values. When run on the IonQ Aria-1 quantum computer, it reproduced ground-state energies with over 90 percent fidelity. The agreement of results across simulators and physical devices indicates that the package yields consistent and transferable energies.</p> Conclusions <p>QuPepFold offers an approachable yet extendable framework for integrating quantum techniques into peptide folding studies, particularly for sampling the ensembles of intrinsically disordered regions. By hiding the technical details of circuit construction and error mitigation, it lowers the barrier to using quantum computers in structural biology and opens opportunities for drug discovery against disordered proteins that have long been considered difficult to target.</p>

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Molecular dynamics (MD) is a central computational tool in physics, chemistry, and biology, enabling quantitative prediction of experimental observables as expectations over high-dimensional molecular distributions such as Boltzmann distributions and transition densities. However, conventional MD is fundamentally limited by the high computational cost required to generate independent samples. Generative molecular dynamics (GenMD) has recently emerged as an alternative, learning surrogates of molecular distributions either from data or through interaction with energy models. While these methods enable efficient sampling, their transferability across molecular systems is often limited. In this work, we show that incorporating auxiliary sources of information can improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics. We find that coarse-grained TITO models are substantially more data-efficient than Boltzmann Emulators, and that incorporating protein language model (pLM) embeddings further improves out-of-distribution generalization. Our approach, PLaTITO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on equilibrium sampling benchmarks for out-of-distribution protein systems, including fast-folding proteins. We further study the impact of additional conditioning signals -- such as structural embeddings, temperature, and large-language-model-derived embeddings -- on model performance.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Munc13-1 is a key protein involved in priming synaptic vesicles for rapid release at the presynaptic plasma membrane. It was previously revealed that Munc13-1 cycles between at least two alternate conformations, an upright (open) molecular conformation organized as a trimer and a lateral (closed) conformation organized as a hexagon. Munc13 binds PI(4,5)P
                    2
                    , a plasma membrane phospholipid essential for vesicle docking and fusion. We report that Munc13 is recruited to PI(4,5)P
                    2
                    domains induced by a Syntaxin-1A juxta-membrane peptide in supported bilayers. Statistical analysis of the copy numbers of Munc13 within the domains suggests that Munc13 exists in clusters of three molecules, i.e., it assembles into trimers. The trimeric clusters disappear with engineered interface mutations disrupting the upright trimers in cryo-EM as well as reconstituted vesicle priming suggesting the trimers observed on bilayers are identical to the upright trimer structures. These upright trimers can also be identified by cryo-electron tomography on vesicles containing PI(4,5)P

                    C domains, as shown by the effect of mutations that disrupt synaptic vesicle binding in synapses. We propose a two-step model for vesicle priming: i) synaptic vesicles are captured by clusters of upright trimers of Munc13 that self-assemble within PI(4,5)P

                    enriched domains; ii) these trimers transition into lateral hexamers when vesicles have bound and the transition would be promoted when the closed conformation of Munc13 is stabilized by diacylglycerol binding, resulting from Ca

### Thermodynamic Optimization of Sensory Adaptation via Game-Theoretic Path Integrals

**Authors:** Gunn Kim

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Biological sensory systems, from \textit{E.~coli} chemotaxis to sensory neurons in \textit{C.~elegans}, achieve reliable adaptation over wide dynamic ranges despite operating in strongly noisy and overdamped regimes. Here, we present a field-theoretic framework in which sensory adaptation emerges from a variational free-energy principle, formulated as a stochastic differential game between an organism and its environment. Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \approx τγ$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning. Quantitative fits to experimental data across species yield $R^2 > 0.88$, and indicate that adaptive sensory processing operates within a narrow thermodynamically optimal regime bounded by signal-to-noise and stability constraints.

### Defect structures and transitions in active nematic membranes

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We investigate the dynamics of active nematic liquid crystals on deformable membranes, focusing on the interplay between active stress and anisotropic curvature coupling. Using a minimal model, we simulate the coupled evolution of the nematic order parameter and membrane height. We demonstrate a continuous transition from a curvature-dominated regime, where topological defects are trapped by local deformation, to an activity-dominated regime exhibiting active turbulence. A scaling analysis reveals that the critical activity threshold $ζ_c$ scales as $α^2/κ$, where $α$ and $κ$ are the coupling constant and bending stiffness, respectively; this relationship is confirmed by our numerical results. Furthermore, we find that significant correlations between the orientational pattern and membrane geometry persist even in the turbulent regime. Specifically, we identify that "walls" in the director field induce characteristic wave-like curvature profiles, providing a mechanism for dynamic coupling between order and shape. These results offer a physical framework for understanding defect-mediated deformation in nonequilibrium biological membranes.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The rational design of proteins that maintain structural integrity under concurrent thermal, mechanical, and chemical stress remains a challenge in molecular engineering. We present a hierarchical framework that transforms an helical domain into an ultrastable scaffold by integrating AI-guided design with foundational chemical principles. This approach progresses from global architectural reinforcement, using multiple AI tools to create a stabilized four-helix bundle, to local chemical tuning, where AlphaFold3 guides the installation of salt bridges and metal-coordination motifs. A computational pipeline using physics-based screening such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations efficiently distilled millions of designs into a minimal candidate set. The resulting helical proteins exhibit unprecedented multi-axis stability, with mechanical unfolding forces exceeding 200 pN, thermal resilience >100 C, and high resistance to chemical denaturants. By systematically dissecting the contributions of hydrophobic packing, electrostatics, and metal coordination, we establish a general blueprint for imparting extreme robustness. This work bridges AI-driven structural generation with chemical precision, advancing the creation of durable proteins for mechanistic studies and synthetic biology.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
System identification approaches are commonly used in engineering to infer simple yet predictive models of complex systems from their responses to time-dependent perturbations. Here, we apply this strategy at the whole organism scale, establishing a predictive model of commitment to metamorphosis in
                    Drosophila
                    . At this critical point in animal development, the larva stops feeding and proceeds to take on the adult form. The neuroendocrine circuits governing commitment to metamorphosis assess the growth and patterning programs, eventually triggering the production of systemic hormones that terminate growth and initiate metamorphosis. Previous studies of these circuits relied on relatively static genetic perturbations and starvation experiments. Here, we take advantage of optogenetic approaches in
                    Drosophila
                    to flexibly perturb a key signaling node within the endocrine gland in otherwise undisturbed larvae. We used this approach to infer parameters in a compact mathematical model and demonstrate that it makes accurate predictions of larval commitment to metamorphosis. Our work paves the way for quantitative studies of other juvenile-to-adult transitions, including mammalian puberty, which relies on strikingly similar mechanisms.

### Neural Activity Related Sodium (NARS) fMRI Resolves Millisecond Neuronal Dynamics in the Rodent Cortex

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Brain-wide, noninvasive methods that directly resolve neuronal activity on millisecond timescales are still lacking in neuroimaging. Hemodynamic fMRI (1H based) provides whole brain maps of activity, yet its vascular origin creates spatial and temporal displacements from neuronal events that complicate interpretation, especially in disease conditions where neurovascular coupling is altered. Here, we developed an ultrafast 23Na fMRI platform at 14 T that combines a reshuffled k-t 3D gradient echo readout (TR/TE, 10ma/1ms) with an implantable RF coil and respiration gated acquisition. This configuration provides the sampling rate and SNR needed to probe quadrupolar T2*-weighted single quantum sodium dynamics on the neuronal timescale. Across rats and mice, somatosensory forepaw stimulation produced a localized 23Na signal decrease of ~2-3% in the FP-S1, peaking ~10-30 ms post-stimulus. The activity pattern is well matched with conventional BOLD-fMRI maps acquired in the same animals. Trial by trial measurements during simultaneous iGluSnFR glutamate fiber photometry demonstrated that larger evoked glutamate transients coincided with larger NARS decreases, supporting a neuronal origin of the NARS contrast. We interpret the negative NARS response as a transient activity dependent redistribution of sodium ions toward restricted, protein rich microdomains that enhances quadrupolar interactions and modestly accelerates T2*short, which is sufficient to yield a 2-3% signal drop without requiring large changes in bulk sodium concentration. Together, these results establish neural activity-related sodium (NARS) fMRI as a viable approach for direct, mesoscale neuronal mapping with MRI at millisecond resolution.

### DNA binding drives phase separation of the Gcn4 bZIP domain and reveals its conformational ensemble in the diluted and condensate phases

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Liquid-liquid phase separation is widely invoked in transcriptional regulation, yet prevailing models attribute condensate formation primarily to intrinsically disordered activation domains rather than structured DNA-binding motifs. Here, we overturn this view by demonstrating that the isolated basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain of the yeast transcription factor Gcn4 undergoes robust DNA-induced phase separation in the complete absence of its activation domain. Using small-angle X-ray scattering in combination with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and ensemble optimization, we directly resolve the conformational landscape of the Gcn4 bZIP-DNA complex across coexisting dilute and condensed phases. Beyond the canonical uninterrupted helical conformation captured in crystal structures, we identify a previously unrecognized minor population featuring a pronounced helical kink at the basic region-leucine zipper junction. These findings establish DNA binding as a sufficient physical driver of bZIP phase separation and demonstrate that small-angle scattering can quantitatively interrogate protein conformational ensembles within biomolecular condensates, opening new avenues for the structural chemistry of phase-separated systems.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) has transformed structural biology by enabling high-resolution reconstruction of macromolecular complexes from noisy projection images. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity and low signal-to-noise ratio of cryo-EM datasets make 2D classification a critical and computationally demanding step in the processing workflow. Here, we introduce AlignPCA-2D, a PCA-space Euclidean vector alignment method for fast, interpretable 2D classification in cryo-EM. By projecting particle images and class representations into a compressed latent PCA space, AlignPCA-2D reduces data dimensionality while preserving meaningful structural variability. The image-to-class assignment is then performed using Euclidean distance, enabling efficient and accurate classification. We benchmark AlignPCA-2D against established cryo-EM software, such as RELION and cryoSPARC, and demonstrate that it achieves competitive alignment accuracy while substantially reducing computational cost. This approach provides a lightweight alternative for large-scale 2D classification tasks, and its modular design makes it compatible with existing cryo-EM processing pipelines.

Correlative microscopy techniques are used for many different applications in the biological sciences because the comparison of different imaging methods allows researchers to gain more insight and data from samples. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) methods have been developed to preserve biological samples to withstand the harsh environments necessary for electron microscopy. After first being imaged using widefield (WF) and super-resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SIM), a NanoSuit chemical treatment was applied to a mammalian testis sample before imaging with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This was done to compare the image quality and resolution of each technique. SEM yields higher resolution and offers validation of results from SIM.

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The human cathelicidin host defense peptide LL-37 forms complexes with nucleic acids that can have either beneficial or detrimental health effects. We suggest that these differential impacts are directly connected to dsDNA binding by LL-37 and to complex formation between protomers. Here, we show using phage {lambda} DNA that LL-37 binds non-specifically to dsDNA, condensing it, followed by complex formation between LL-37 peptides. We find that complex formation is concentration-dependent, with low LL-37 amounts yielding loosely aggregated DNA structures, while higher LL-37 concentrations lead to well-defined, disc-like structures of about 150 nm in diameter. The condensation of the nucleic acids, which causes a loss of the characteristic B-DNA features, results from interactions of the phosphodiester backbone with protonated amino acid side chains of the peptide at physiological pH, predominantly in A-T rich sequences of the nucleic acid. However, in our studies, electrostatic interactions did not appear to be the driving force for complexation, but rather we found the -helical structure of the peptide with its amphipathic and hydrophobic surfaces to be essential. Further, we show that LL-37 also interacts with nucleic acids from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in a concentration-dependent way, causing a reduction in NET aggregate area, which may offer new biophysical insights into diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which involve slower-than-normal NET clearance. Our results indicate the key importance of LL-37 expression levels for regulation of the innate immune system for optimal human health, since the relative amounts of expressed LL-37 present to interact with extracellular DNA will determine the extent to which the DNA can be condensed, which in turn will affect the ability of the body to clear the NETs before they can cause inflammatory conditions.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
TDP-43 is a model protein for pathophysiological phase transitions, forming a multitude of intracellular assemblies with different physical properties. Physiological condensation is widely presumed to precede pathological aggregation, but the causal relationships between different modes of assembly in vivo are still unclear. Here we use Distributed Amphifluoric FRET (DAmFRET) and complementary approaches to map the phase space of TDP-43 self-assembly in yeast cells. We discovered that the low-complexity C-terminal domain (CTD) on its own populates dynamically arrested soluble clusters rather than condensates. These clusters uniquely supported amyloid formation, and only when templated by pre-existing amyloids of other proteins. Other features of full-length TDP-43, pathological C-terminal fragments, or fusion partners that self-interacted blocked amyloid nucleation by allowing CTD clusters to further condense. Stress and cotranslational condensation had the same effect. Our findings reveal that TDP-43 amyloid formation occurs only under very specific physical and biological circumstances that could present new opportunities for therapeutic control.

### Sub-Millivolt Voltage Imaging Reveals Gap Junction-Mediated Bioelectric Contact Inhibition

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Sub-millivolt membrane potential (Vm) dynamics in multicellular non-excitable networks have remained largely invisible due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive imaging tools. Here, we introduce rEstus2s, a next-generation genetically encoded voltage indicator that overcomes this barrier by enabling high-resolution Vm imaging across the full physiological resting Vm range (-100 to 0 mV). Using rEstus2s, we uncover bioelectric contact inhibition (BCI), a fundamental biophysical principle where gap junction coupling acts as a passive noise filter to stabilize Vm. We demonstrate that the time-dependent variance of Vm (electrical volatility) relative to the number of cells (n) in a network follows a 1/n scaling law, reflecting a transition from stochastic single-cell behavior to collective electrical stability. While Ca2+-activated oncogenic ion channels, including ANO1 and KCa3.1, promote pronounced electrical volatility in isolated cells, BCI effectively attenuates volatility in electrically coupled networks. Disruption of gap junction coupling in cancer cells abolishes BCI and restores high electrical volatility. These findings establish a unifying biophysical framework for understanding how multicellularity maintains electrical homeostasis in health and disease.

Chlorosomes are main light-harvesting complexes of green photosynthetic bacteria. Pigments are organized in self-assembling aggregates within chlorosomes rather than being coordinated by proteins as seen for other photosynthetic complexes. Chlorosomes isolated from Chloroflexus aurantiacus were subjected to cryo-electron tomography which revealed the long-range organization of bacteriochlorophyll c within the chlorosome interior. The resulting electrostatic scattering potential map is well described by a planar lamellar model.

### Morphological instability of an invasive active-passive interface

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Morphological instabilities of growing tissues that impinge on passive materials are typical of invasive cancers. To explain these instabilities in experiments on breast epithelial spheroids in an extracellular matrix, we develop a continuum phase field model of a growing active liquid expanding into a passive viscoelastic matrix. Linear stability analysis of the sharp-interface limit of the governing equations predicts that the tissue interface can develops long-wavelength instabilities, but these instabilities are suppressed when the active carcinoid is embedded in an elastic matrix. We develop a theoretical morphological phase diagram, and complement these with two-dimensional finite element (FEM) phase-field simulations to track the nonlinear evolution of the interface with results consistent with theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Our study provides a basis for the emergence of interfacial instabilities in active-passive systems with the potential to control them.

### What is active wetting?

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
In recent years the term \textit{active wetting} has gained some traction in works describing, analyzing and modeling a wide variety of wetting phenomena, for instance, in the contexts of biomolecular condensates, of cell layers or cell aggregates, and of active Brownian particles. The present perspective proposes a coarse classification of wetting phenomena including a tentative definition of active wetting. First, different categories of static and dynamic wetting of passive liquids are briefly discussed, in particular, distinguishing equilibrium wetting, relaxational wetting, driven wetting, and reactive wetting. Second, an overview is given of the various phenomena recently described as active wetting. We conclude by discussing a possible definition of active wetting together with a number of caveats one might want to keep in mind when using such classifications.

### Whodunnit? The case of midge swarms

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
As collective states of animal groups go, swarms of midge insects pose a number of puzzling questions. Their ordering polarization parameter is quite small and the insects are weakly coupled among themselves but strongly coupled to the swarm. In laboratory studies (free of external perturbations), the correlation length is small, whereas midge swarms exhibit strong correlations, scale free behavior and power laws for correlation length, susceptibility and correlation time in field studies. Data for the dynamic correlation function versus time collapse to a single curve only for small values of time scaled with the correlation time. Is there a theory that explains these disparate observations? Among the existing theories, whodunnit? Here we review and discuss several models proposed in the literature and extend our own one, the harmonically confined Vicsek model, to anisotropic confinement. Numerical simulations of the latter produce elongated swarm shapes and values of the static critical exponents between those of the two dimensional and isotropic three dimensional models. The new values agree better with those measured in natural swarms.

### Theory for enzymatic degradation of semi-crystalline polymer particles

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
In enzymatic recycling or biodegradation of semi-crystalline plastic waste, crystalline spherulites embedded into an amorphous matrix hinder and slow down depolymerisation. When the enzymatic depolymerisation temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature, these spherulites tend to grow. The depolymerisation process is thus controlled by a competition between erosion of the amorphous matrix from the particle surface and the growth of recalcitrant spherulites within the particle bulk and at its surface. We present a geometric model that captures this competition, together with an algorithm to solve the equations numerically. Our algorithm introduces a new extension of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellation in space. We extract the parameters for the model from experimental data on the enzymatic depolymerization by hydrolase LCC-ICCG of PET bottle flakes and textile waste, in order to make a prediction of the observed degradation yield as a function of time. Both the final yield and the degradation kinetics are correctly predicted. Most importantly, the model clarifies how and to which extent nucleating agents, impurities, additives, and/or rapid crystal growth present in the waste can undermine pretreatment efforts aiming to initiate depolymerisation from a material with a low initial crystallinity.

### The chiral random walk: A quantum-inspired framework for odd diffusion

**Authors:** Jan Wójcik, Erik Kalz

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Chirality in active and passive fluids gives rise to odd transport properties, most notably the emergence of robust edge currents that defy standard dissipative dynamics. While these phenomena are well-described by continuum hydrodynamics, a microscopic framework connecting them to their topological origins has remained elusive. Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p<1$). This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators. Our results provide a discrete microscopic description for odd diffusion, offering a powerful toolkit to predict transport in confined geometries and disordered chiral media.

### A dialog between cell adhesion and topology at the core of morphogenesis

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
During the development of an organism, cells must coordinate and organize to generate the correct shape, structure, and spatial patterns of tissues and organs, a process known as morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of embryonic tissues is supported by multiple processes that induce the precise physical deformations required for tissues to ultimately form organs with complex geometries. Among the most active players shaping the morphogenetic path are fine-tuned changes in cell adhesion. In this paper, we show that a local, pair-wise property defined at the cell-cell contact level has important global consequences for embryonic tissue topology, being determinant in defining both the geometric and material properties of early embryo tissues.

### The potential impact of wheat stem rust on global agricultural supply, demand, and food security, considering market interactions

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<p>by Benjamin Schiek, Athanasios Petsakos, Mesut Keser, Nicola Cenacchi, Timothy B. Sulser, Keith Wiebe</p>  Wheat stem rust, a fungal disease that can be highly devastating under the right environmental conditions, was reduced to non-economically damaging levels during the Green Revolution. However, it has reemerged as a global threat to wheat production due to the appearance of new virulent strains in Uganda in 1999 that have spread steadily to other geographic areas. Wheat experts warn that the disease could pose a catastrophic threat to the global wheat supply if not monitored. Considering the importance of wheat as a principal source of calories, nutrients, and farm income throughout the world, assessments of the potential impacts of the disease are urgently required in order to formulate an appropriate response. Published assessments so far vary widely in method and results, and generally focus on wheat production losses alone, without considering how markets may offset or aggravate impacts (spillover effects). Here we take an integrated assessment approach and examine a set of “what-if” scenarios to account for direct and indirect economic and food security impacts of wheat stem rust in various world regions over the years 2026–2050. The severity and frequency of epidemics is introduced into the modeling framework based on a survey of international wheat experts. The results suggest that global market incentives may offset the worst impacts of wheat stem rust in most affected areas via international trade. However, the market mechanism simultaneously precipitates considerable food insecurity in areas far from any epidemic, as farms in these areas reallocate resources from the domestic cereal market to the wheat export market, in response to price signals.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Manual annotation of the images of thin tissue sections remains a time-consuming step in Mueller microscopy and limits its scalability. We present a novel automated approach using only the total intensity M11 element of the Mueller matrix as an input to a U-Net architecture with a pretrained ResNet-34 encoder. The network was trained to distinguish four classes in the images of murine uterine cervix sections: background, internal os, cervical tissue, and vaginal wall. With only 70 cervical tissue sections, the model achieved 89.71% pixel accuracy and 80.96% mean tissue Dice coefficient on the held-out test dataset. Transfer learning from ImageNet enables accurate segmentation despite limited size of training dataset typical of specialized biomedical imaging. This intensity-based framework requires minimal preprocessing and is readily extensible to other imaging modalities and tissue types, with publicly available graphical annotation tools for practical deployment.

### How Geometry Tames Disorder in Lattice Fracture

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We investigate the fracture behavior of pre-cracked triangular beam-lattices whose elements have failure stresses drawn from a Weibull distribution. Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials.

### Dynamic Bidirectional Coupling of Membrane Morphology and Rod Organization in Flexible Vesicles

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The ordering of rod-like particles in soft, deformable containers emerges from the interplay of anisotropic interactions, geometric confinement, and boundary compliance. This competition couples internal particle organization to container morphology and is central to biological processes such as cell motility, division, and encapsulation, in which cytoskeletal filaments confined by lipid membranes actively reshape cells. Using a minimal model combining experiments and simulations of colloidal rods encapsulated in lipid vesicles, we show that soft confinement drives a bidirectional coupling between internal order and vesicle shape. This interplay gives rise to a phase diagram in which elongated vesicles promote nematic alignment at lower packing fractions, whereas higher packing fractions induce smectic-like ordering that reshapes vesicles into plate-like morphologies with increased bending energy. Furthermore, by controlling vesicle volume and membrane area, we demonstrate that these boundary conditions enable reversible tuning of both vesicle shape and internal rod organization. This study establishes a promising route for dynamically controlling colloidal self-assembly in soft containers and for mimicking ordering in cell-like compartments.

Distillation of multipartite quantum correlations usually demands coordinated operations by all parties sharing the state.

The exact local filtering operations are derived, and the protocol’s performance is characterized by analytical expressions for the success probability and output fidelity, supported by numerical simulations.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Entangled granular systems exhibit mechanical rigidity and resistance to deformation, reminiscent of cohesive materials, due to their reduced degrees of freedom and contact friction. A quantitative understanding of how classical granular phenomena, such as shear localization and plastic flow, appear in such geometrically cohesive systems remains unknown. Here, we investigate this using granular chain ensembles subjected to direct shear tests. Our experiments reveal that chains longer than four beads exhibit pronounced shear hardening, which is nearly independent of the applied normal stress and is accompanied by the complete suppression of shear localization. The volume dilation of the long chain ensembles also does not vanish in the steady state. We complement this phenomenology, which is distinct from that of typical frictional granular ensembles, with DEM simulations. The simulations reveal that tensile forces are generated due to particles being locally jammed, characterized by a high non-covalent coordination number. Consequently, this leads to a deformation that shows a very diffuse region of localization and enhanced shear hardening. Overall, our study highlights that granular chains provide a systematic route to map how connectivity constraints impact flow properties and mechanical rigidity.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The flow field generated by a swimming bacterium serves as a fundamental building block for understanding hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria. Although the flow field generated by a force dipole (stresslet) well captures the fluid motion in the far field limit, the stresslet description does not work in the near-field limit, which can be important in microswimmer interactions. Here we propose the model combining an anisotropically regularized stresslet with an isotropically regularized source dipole, and it nicely reproduces the flow field around a swimming bacterium, which is validated by the experimental measurements of the flow field around \textit{E. coli} and our boundary-element-method simulations of a helical microswimmer, in both cases of the free space and the confined space with a no-slip wall. This work provides a practical tool for obtaining the flow field of the bacterium, and can be utilised to study the collective responses of bacteria in dense suspensions.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The rotational diffusion of a rigid spherical body decorated with dimers in an explicit fluid environment is reported. This model acts as a simplified representation of an enveloped virus bearing peplomers immersed in a coarse-grained fluid. Using dissipative particle dynamics, we explicitly study the hydrodynamic effects on the rotational diffusion of this virus-inspired particle subjected to oscillatory shear flow and confined between two solid-like surfaces. Since the rotational response depends on the type of imposed flow, we first characterize the oscillatory shear, identifying distinct flow regimes in terms of the so-called Péclet number, $Pe$. Our findings indicate that, under confinement, the rotational diffusivity is strongly modulated by the oscillatory flow amplitude and only weakly affected by the number of peplomers, since their effect is mainly determined by their dimeric structure and associated effective size. For high $Pe$, the rotational diffusion coefficient, $D_{r}$, tends to decrease as the number of peplomers ($N_{s}$) increases, whereas at low $Pe$, rotational diffusion becomes weakly dependent on the number of peplomers. However, at intermediate values of $Pe$, the interplay between oscillatory forcing and thermal fluctuations prevents the emergence of a clear trend between $D_{r}$ and $N_{s}$. Our results provide a clear picture of how, in confined environments, the interplay between fluid flow and thermal fluctuations affects the rotational diffusion of spiked particles, thereby helping to explain how fluid conditions can modify the alignment of peplomers with their potential targets.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The HIV-1 assembly process is driven by the structural protein Gag, which forms small cytosolic oligomers that are later trafficked to the cell membrane. While Gag alone is sufficient to drive particle formation, the incorporation of GagPol, a polyprotein comprising Gag and viral enzymes, is essential for productive infection. Maintenance of the proper Gag:GagPol ratio is essential for infectivity. Yet, the mechanisms regulating their cytosolic interactions remain incompletely understood, in part because most studies rely on ensemble biochemical assays that hide cell-to-cell heterogeneity and lack spatial and temporal resolution. To overcome these limitations and investigate the dynamics of GagPol at the molecule level, we systematically tested different approaches to fluorescently label it. We successfully produced two functional fluorescent GagPol variants: one single-labeled GagPol, and a second double-labeled variant with a fluorescent protein added within Gag, that allows concurrent visualization of Gag and GagPol. These labeled versions, in combination with the use of raster image (cross-) correlation spectroscopy, enabled the quantification of Gag and GagPol relative concentrations and intermolecular interactions at the single-cell level. Overall, these variants set the stage for in-depth investigations of GagPol during HIV assembly providing insights into cytoplasmic trafficking, particle assembly, and the kinetics of these processes.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Proteins are dynamic molecular machines whose functions are determined by their structures. While static structures can offer initial insights or hypotheses about protein function, they are often insufficient for a detailed mechanistic understanding. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic view of proteins dynamic motion and conformational change, but the resulting high-dimensional data are challenging to interpret. Traditional summary statistics and dimensionality-reduction methods often focus on global motions and can overlook regional, yet functionally critical motions. Inspired by approaches from social network science, we introduce a novel perspective for analyzing MD simulations through dynamic community detection, where molecules are modeled as time-evolving graphs, and communities of residues or atoms that move coherently or exhibit functional coupling are identified. We present DynMoCo, a novel deep learning framework that integrates graph convolutional networks with recurrent models for end-to-end dynamic community detection on molecular graphs. Given a MD trajectory, DynMoCo identifies spatially grounded substructures, tracks their evolution over time, and can incorporate structural knowledge to ensure physically meaningful communities. We provide a library of custom-written scripts to allow users to extract and visualize these communites on the MD simulated molecules in motion. We demonstrate the method on force-ramp and force-clamp steered MD simulations of three integrin systems, revealing modular substructures within known domains and characterizing their conformational rearrangements during force-induced unbending. By reducing high-dimensional MD data into interpretable communities, this approach offers new insights into the intrinsic organization and dynamic function of complex biomolecular systems.  SIGNIFICANCEProteins often perform their functions through dynamic, locally coordinated motions. Molecular dynamics simulations provide detailed views of these motions but produce high-dimensional data that are challenging to analyze and interpret. We present a novel deep learning model that analyzes molecular dynamics simulations data and identifies structurally coherent and potentially functionally related communities, while tracking their temporal evolution. This analysis tool provides a novel way to analyze MD data transforming it into interpretable representations of modular dynamic, enabling discovery of new mechanistic insights and advancing our understanding of how molecular motions drive biological function.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Determining the identity, quantity and interactions of proteins is fundamental to studies of biomolecular function and (dis)regulation in disease. Here, we combine mass photometry with supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) to specifically recruit proteins of interest from complex mixtures such as cell lysate and demonstrate sensitive detection and mass measurement of single biomolecules and their complexes without prior purification. Extending to heterologously expressed proteins, we provide rapid information on oligomerisation and concentration in lysate. Introduction of polyethylene glycol in the SLBs passivates against a variety of cell lysates and serum, allows specific recruitment of proteins from complex mixtures and mass-specific detection and affinity measurement at sub-nM concentrations. Our approach preserves the mass resolution and accuracy of mass photometry, thereby enabling visualisation and quantification of oligomeric states, interactions and complexes directly from cell lysates.

### Structural insights into PFAS-β-lactoglobulin binding mechanism mediating PFAS toxicity

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The strong, polar-covalent nature of C-F bonds contributes to the forever nature of per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances. PFAS are toxic to humans. Here, we have examined the ability of the small, globular, milk protein {beta}-lactoglobulin to bind PFAS. The protein transports hydrophobic and amphiphilic compounds, including retinol and fatty acids, for vision and brain development; therefore, underscoring its interactions with PFAS is significant. The crystal structures of {beta}-lactoglobulin complexed with PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) at 2.0 ([A]), PFOS (Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) at 2.5 ([A]), and PFDA (Perfluorodecanoic acid) at 2.0 ([A]) reveal high affinity of the compounds for the central calyx of {beta}-lactoglobulin, which is the canonical retinol and fatty acid binding site. Analyses of the data indicate significant hydrophobic interactions stabilizing the binding of the PFAS hydrophobic "tails" within the calyx and interactions between Lys60 and Lys69 and PFAS polar head groups. Comparative structural analysis revealed the presence of an open conformation of the EF loop containing the Glu89 latch residue in the complexed structures vis-a-vis the apo-form. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed high stability of the PFAS binding and attainment of energy minima in all complexes. The average binding energy of PFDA in {beta}-lactoglobulin calyx was -25 kcal/mol, which was higher than PFOS (-21 kcal/mol) and PFOA (-23 kcal/mol) due to increased van der Waals interactions of the longer hydrophobic chain of PFDA with {beta}-lactoglobulin. This work advances a mechanism by which {beta}-lactoglobulin can recruit PFAS and act as a transporter for the "forever" chemical, potentially mediating its neurotoxicity.

### A mechanism-aware stoichiometry platform resolves functional viral thresholds and induces antiviral hypersensitivity

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Antiviral discovery is frequently hindered by a  stoichiometric blind spot--a lack of resolution regarding the functional density of viral enzymes required for replication. Traditional screening pipelines rely on target-based or phenotypic assays that cannot distinguish between simple molecular binding and the crossing of a functional  stoichiometric cliff. Here, we present a mechanism-aware platform that resolves these enzymatic requirements with single-virion precision. By integrating quantitative cryo-electron microscopy and genomic validation with Monte Carlo modeling, we map the stoichiometric landscapes of HIV-1 Protease (PR) and Reverse Transcriptase (RT). We uncover a striking disparity in enzymatic demand: a high-redundancy  buffering capacity for PR ([~]40 monomers) contrasted with a high-threshold requirement for RT ([~]95 subunits). We demonstrate that by systematically  de-buffering the virion, our platform induces a state of antiviral hypersensitivity, enabling the detection of therapeutic activity in novel and clinical inhibitors that remain invisible to traditional workflows. Furthermore, this multiplexed profiling enables de novo target identification, as inhibitors trigger failure exclusively on their respective stoichiometric arms. This platform provides a deterministic roadmap for de-risking drug discovery and identifying viral sub-stoichiometric vulnerabilities.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Many economists contend that humans have strong, universal, other-regarding equality preferences with deep evolutionary roots. Indeed, many hunter-gatherers have endemic food-sharing and proscriptions against accumulation. These “egalitarian” practices appear superficially consistent with intrinsic equality preferences. Previous experiments, involving donating positive endowments to strangers, seldom match the redistributive equality observed in real-world sharing. Such methods ignore the role of taking, and do not capture sharing dynamics among differentially wealthy campmates. This study, instead, uses a one-player “give-or-take” experiment, with real campmates as recipients, better emulating real-world forager food redistribution. We asked 117 Hadza participants, privately, to redistribute food resources between themselves and a campmate after receiving advantageous and disadvantageous endowments. Although few participants were wholly self-interested, most did not seek general equality. Instead, most tolerated inequality when it benefited them but not when it benefited others. Given advantageous endowments, a minority (40.9%) chose to give, while 30% exacerbated inequality by taking more. Given disadvantageous endowments, many took more than necessary to achieve equality. The modal decision across tasks was to take everything. Only when participants could take from others did results approximate real-world sharing patterns. Findings suggest that intrinsic, private other-regarding fairness preferences need not underlie widespread forager food-sharing, which could be maintained by others’ self-motivated demands or extrinsic fairness norms. We also found that men and younger people were more willing to give away advantageous endowments. Further, we found that individuals with greater exposure to cultures outside Hadzaland were more accepting of unfavorable inequality, suggesting that marketization might promote disadvantageous inequality tolerance.</span>

### Mid-infrared light produces anti-ageing effects through resonant absorption by living organisms

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Ageing is commonly viewed as a consequence of cumulative molecular damage and declining stress resilience. However, this perspective overlooks the possibility that ageing may primarily arise from an efficiency loss of integrated cellular operation. Here, we show that ageing can be systemically prevented by enhancing cellular efficiency using frequency-specific mid-infrared (MIR) light, as revealed by multiscale (organismal-, cellular- and molecular-level) analyses of Caenorhabditis elegans. Remarkably, super-weak 34-THz MIR light ([~]1 W{middle dot}mm-{superscript 2}) prolonged the median lifespan of worms by 60%, delaying ageing onset and preventing abrupt "cliff-edge" mortality, without detectable thermal effects. At the cellular level, MIR exposure enhanced global gene transcription in parallel with the establishment of a mitochondrial state of high-efficiency energy metabolism, together preserving youthful cellular homoeostasis during ageing. These cellular effects were associated with vibrational modes of phosphate groups (PO4) in nucleic acids and mitochondrial phospholipids within the 33-35 THz range, providing a frequency-matched molecular context for MIR modulation. Together, our results support an efficiency-first, systemic anti-ageing model in which frequency-specific MIR light resonantly enhances the integrated kinetic efficiency of cellular systems, spanning gene transcriptional dynamics and mitochondrial bioenergetic flux, rather than the activation of damage-repair or stress-response pathways. These findings advance our understanding of MIR light-matter interactions in living systems and establish a non-biochemical, physical strategy for modulating ageing.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
How thousands of microtubules (MTs) and molecular motors self-organize into spindles remains poorly understood. By combining static, nanometer-resolution, large-scale electron tomography reconstructions and dynamic, optical-resolution, polarized light microscopy, we test an active liquid crystal continuum theory of mitotic spindles in human tissue culture cells. At micron length scales, probed by optical microscopy, the continuum theory accurately captures spindle morphology and fluctuation spectra, indicating that local interactions-polymerization, alignment, diffusion, and polar transport-govern the collective behaviors of MTs in human mitotic spindles. Electron tomography data enables tests of the continuum theory at submicron scales, revealing that chromosome-attached kinetochore microtubules (KMTs) show distinctive lateral organization not explained by the coarse-grained theory, while the non-KMTs that make up the bulk of the spindle follow the theory down to ∼300 nm length scales. At length scales below ∼300 nm, fluctuations arising from the intrinsic discreteness of the microtubule ensemble dominate over the collective correlations predicted from the continuum theory. Taken together, these findings show that an active liquid-crystal theory can quantitatively capture the self-organization of human mitotic spindles on long length scales and provides a means to measure the spindle’s material properties, while also pointing to the existence of additional processes contributing to the behaviors of KMTs.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Proteins exist in diverse biochemical states, including oligomers, complexes, heterogeneous proteoforms and shed fragments that encode functional and regulatory information. Yet, these molecular states remain difficult to resolve with existing analytical techniques, which typically require labelling, immobilisation or amplification and collapse this information into a single readout. Here, we introduce a modular platform that integrates programmable DNA nanostructures with single-molecule mass photometry for rapid, label-free and multiplexed protein analysis in native and complex media, without washing, enrichment or immobilisation, making native biochemical states observable directly in serum and plasma. DNA nanostructures act as nanosensors whose mass and mobility on supported lipid bilayers provide orthogonal identifiers for target identity and biochemical state, thereby decoupling recognition from readout. We define the analytical specificity and response window, demonstrate quantitative affinity determination, and resolve oligomeric and proteoform differences under native conditions. The nanosensors are rapidly reprogrammable to new targets, support multiplexed detection with internal controls for non-specific interactions, and enable selective resetting via strand displacement. Together, these capabilities establish nanoscale programmability as a route to state-resolved single-molecule protein profiling adaptable to both diagnostic and mechanistic applications.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes is a central mechanism of intercellular communication in the brain and plays a key role in regulating neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and energy metabolism. Disruption of astrocytic Ca2+ dynamics is a characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases, as are deviations in cholesterol trafficking and metabolism, which are essential for maintaining membrane structure and function. Although recent studies have begun to explore links between Ca2+ signaling and sterol homeostasis in astrocytes, unbiased analytical workflows and mechanistic insight into how cholesterol and related sterols regulate astrocytic Ca2+ dynamics remain limited.  Here, we apply dynamic mode decomposition to dissect and classify Ca2+ signals obtained from time-lapse imaging of human astrocytes. Using both synthetic and experimental datasets, we show that delay-embedded dynamic mode decomposition combined with clustering separates heterogeneous Ca2+ activity into distinct dynamical states. This analysis reveals that increasing cholesterol levels shift astrocytes toward more active oscillatory states, whereas acute cholesterol depletion suppresses Ca2+ activity. In addition, pretreatment with the oxysterols 24-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol impaired cholesterolinduced Ca2+ oscillations.  Together, this work presents a general computational framework for decomposing and analyzing complex spatiotemporal Ca2+ signals, with broad applicability to quantitative imaging in cell biology.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>As generative AI enables the creation and dissemination of information at massive scale and speed, it is increasingly important to understand how people perceive AI-generated content. One prominent policy proposal requires explicitly labeling AI-generated content to increase transparency and encourage critical thinking about the information, but prior research has not yet tested the effects of such labels. To address this gap, we conducted a survey experiment (N=1,601) on a diverse sample of Americans, presenting participants with an AI-generated message about several public policies (e.g. allowing colleges to pay student-athletes), randomly assigning whether participants were told the message was generated by (i) an expert AI model, (ii) a human policy expert, or (iii) no label. We found that messages were generally persuasive, influencing participants’ views of the policies by 9.74 percentage points on average. However, while 92.0% of participants assigned to the AI and human label conditions believed the authorship labels, labels had no significant effects on participants’ attitude change toward the policies, judgments of message accuracy, nor intentions to share the message with others. These patterns were robust across a variety of participant characteristics, including prior knowledge of the policy, prior experience with AI, political party, education level, and age. Given current levels of trust in AI content, these results imply that, while authorship labels would likely enhance transparency, they are unlikely to substantially affect the persuasiveness of the labeled content, highlighting the need for alternative strategies to address challenges posed by AI-generated information.</span>

### From Lipid Dynamics to Precision Predictions: A New Approach Method for Precision Modeling of Phosphoinositide Signaling

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Precision medicine requires models that can translate rich molecular measurements into individualized predictions of biological response. Phosphoinositide signaling disorders present an acute challenge, where nonlinear dynamics vary across cell types and are difficult to predict or interpret from measurements alone without mechanistic modeling. We developed a sensitivity analysis-guided New Approach Methodology (NAM) using a multi-step framework and applied it as a proof-of-concept to phosphoinositide signaling. We constructed and optimized a kinetic model of PIP, PIP2, and IP3 dynamics using superior cervical ganglion neuron data, then validated it against independent dose-dependent responses without refitting. We then performed local and global sensitivity analyses to identify dominant parameter drivers of pathway behaviors. Sensitivity-guided parameter variation generated a population of model variants that captured lipid dynamics observed in tsA201 cells, human neuroblastoma cells, and hippocampal neurons. To infer cell-specific models, we implemented two complementary inverse approaches: sensitivity fingerprinting guided by mechanistic sensitivities and a neural network trained on synthetic phosphoinositide time series. Both approaches reproduced experimental PIP, PIP2, and IP3 dynamics across cell types while preserving the baseline model structure. Importantly, the inferred models correctly predicted experimentally observed responses to kinase perturbation without additional fitting: hippocampal neurons with large basal PIP pools maintained signaling under PI4K inhibition, whereas cells with small pools exhibited failure, validating the framework. Simulations of PI4KA and PIP5K1C loss-of-function mutations under repeated stimulation revealed progressive signaling collapse in small-pool cells but sustained function in large-pool cells, demonstrating that basal lipid composition determines genetic vulnerability. The NAM provides a predictive, cell-specific framework for translating dynamic lipid measurements into mechanistic models that support precision medicine applications in phosphoinositide-related disorders.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
In established super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, resolving multiple fluorescent molecules at sub-diffraction distances requires the molecules to emit sequentially so that they become discernible from their neighbors one after another. Simultaneous tracking of multiple fluorophores that are only a few nanometers apart is thus conceptually and practically impossible. We have recently shown that probing a sub-diffraction region with an excitation beam featuring an intensity zero, i.e., MINFLUX, super-resolves and tracks closely packed fluorophores without interruption. Here, we provide a conceptual framework for resolving and tracking constantly emitting fluorophores, more generally, point scatterers, that undergo random changes in position. In particular, we show that the detection rates available in fluorescence microscopy are sufficient to track sub-10 nm distance changes within micro- to milliseconds. By using a DNA origami construct with a fixed and a movable fluorophore as a proxy, we prove the concept that thermally driven conformational changes of biomolecules are continuously detectable with visible light. Conformational changes of the DNA nanostructure leading to random jumps in distance of about 10 nm between two labels are registered within about a millisecond. Our work paves the way towards super-resolving complex conformational transitions of individual biomolecules with focused light.

### A parameterised equation of state, glass transition and jamming of the hard sphere system

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
A Gamma-distribution based potential energy landscape (PEL) theory has recently been proposed for supercooled liquids and glasses. This new PEL theory introduces a singularity term in the equation of state (EoS) suitable for representing the pressure of a glassy or jammed system. Using this framework, a parameterised EoS, Z(eta J), is developed with the random-jammed-packing fraction, eta J, as an input. This EoS is capable of accurately calculating the compressibility (pressure) across the entire metastable and glassy region from eta J=0.62 to 0.66, while seamlessly passing through the stable fluid region. Two special cases (paths) are examined in detail. The first path exhibits a singularity at the random close packing eta J=eta rcp=0.64, traversing the metastable region explored by most simulations. Various thermodynamic properties calculated are compared to simulation data, showing excellent agreements. The second case addresses the first analytical EoS for the ideal glass transition in the hard sphere system. Finally, the transport properties of the hard sphere fluid are modeled using the Arrhenius law and the excess entropy scaling law. It is found that both laws fail (with slope changing) at eta=0.555, where the heat capacity peaks and the contributions of inherent structures and jamming effects begin to emerge.

### Scaling of poroelastic coarsening and elastic arrest in crosslinked gels

**Authors:** Samuel A. Safran

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Recent experiments on crosslinked gels quenched from solvent-rich to solvent-poor conditions, show solvent-rich domains surrounded by gel-rich regions that coarsen followed by kinetic arrest at micron scales that persists for hours before full drainage to macroscopic equilibrium occurs on day timescales. Motivated by this, we present a general model for both coarsening and eventual arrest of pressure-driven coarsening in gels with solvent flow driven by interfacial tension of the solvent-rich domains and the gel. In gels in their viscoelastic time regime, this capillary force is dissipated by solvent transport through crosslinked polymers where the polymers develop transient elastic stresses due to solvent flow. At longer times, the long-ranged, elastic response of the gel provides a deterministic force which balances the capillary force thus arresting pressure-driven coarsening at a stiffness-dependent length. For a melt-like, polymer-rich gel, the coarsening length $\sim t^{1/4}$ where $t$ is the time, with an amplitude $ \sim G^{-1/2}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. The arrest length in this regime also scales $\sim G^{-1/2}$. For low polymer fractions where the dominant length scale is the mesh size, the coarsening length can scale as $t^{1/3}$ varying with $G^{-1/3}$ (as does the arrest length). Our predictions for the arrest-length scaling with $\sim G^{-1/2}$ for the melt-like gel are consistent with the measurements.

### Denoise Stepwise Signals by Diffusion Model Based Approach
**Source:** arXiv

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Stepwise signals are ubiquitous in single-molecule detections, where abrupt changes in signal levels typically correspond to molecular conformational changes or state transitions. However, these features are inevitably obscured by noise, leading to uncertainty in estimating both signal levels and transition points. Traditional frequency-domain filtering is ineffective for denoising stepwise signals, as edge-related high-frequency components strongly overlap with noise. Although Hidden Markov Model-based approaches are widely used, they rely on stationarity assumptions and are not specifically designed for signal denoising. Here, we propose a diffusion model-based algorithm for stepwise signal denoising, named the Stepwise Signal Diffusion Model (SSDM). During training, SSDM learns the statistical structure of stepwise signals via a forward diffusion process that progressively adds noise. In the following reverse process, the model reconstructs clean signals from noisy observations, integrating a multi-scale convolutional network with an attention mechanism. Training data are generated by simulating stepwise signals through a Markov process with additive Gaussian noise. Across a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, SSDM consistently outperforms traditional methods in both signal level reconstruction and transition point detection. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated on experimental data from single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and nanopore DNA translocation measurements. Overall, SSDM provides a general and robust framework for recovering stepwise signals in various single-molecule detections and other physical systems exhibiting discrete state transitions.

### Cell strain-stiffening drives cell breakout from embedded spheroids

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Understanding how cells escape from embedded spheroids requires a mechanical framework linking stress generation within cells, across cells, and between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). We develop such a framework by coupling a 3D vertex model of a spheroid to a fibrous ECM network and deriving a 3D Cauchy stress tensor for deformable polyhedral cells, enabling direct cell-level stress quantification in three dimensions. We analyze maximum shear stress in solid-like and fluid-like spheroids: solid-like spheroids exhibit broader stress distributions and radial stress gradients, while fluid-like spheroids show lower stresses with weak spatial organization. Cell shape anisotropy is not generically aligned with principal stress directions, indicating that morphology alone is an unreliable proxy for mechanical state. We further demonstrate strain stiffening at the single-cell level, where elongation produces nonlinear increases in maximum shear stress, allowing boundary cells in otherwise low-stress, fluid-like spheroids to transiently generate forces sufficient to remodel the matrix. To connect strain-induced stress amplification to invasion modes, we introduce an extended 3D vertex model with explicit, tunable cell-cell adhesion springs. In this minimal mechanical framework, single-cell breakout results from strain stiffening combined with reduced adhesion, whereas multi-cell streaming additionally requires anisotropic adhesion strengthened along the elongation axis and weakened orthogonally. Together, these results identify distinct mechanical pathways coupling cell strain, stress amplification, and adhesion organization to spheroid invasion.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<p>by Shixi Wei, Bing Li, Jinxia Yang, Dengsheng Cai, Wubin Xu, Zhaoyang Liu</p>  To obtain discrete element method simulation parameters for cohesive soil during the scrapping process of loaders, this paper calibrates parameters of cohesive soil with different moisture contents based on the Hertz-Mindlin with Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) Cohesion contact model in Experts in Discrete Element Modeling (EDEM). First, five cohesive soil samples with different moisture contents were prepared. By combining vibration sieving, the inclined plane method, and angle of repose experiments, the measured data ranges of particle size distribution, soil-steel friction coefficient, and angle of repose were obtained. Secondly, the JKR V2 adhesion model was constructed in EDEM. Significant parameters were screened using the Plackett-Burman test. Finally, the response surface analysis range was determined by integrating climbing experiments, and a quadratic regression model was established through Box-Behnken design to optimize parameter combinations. Furthermore, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was introduced for single-objective optimization of the angle of repose. The experimental results show that with the increase of moisture content, the angle of repose increases from 30.83° to 37.13°, and the significant parameters are JKR surface energy, soil-soil restitution coefficient, and static friction coefficient. The simulation error of the PSO algorithm is reduced from the maximum 3.38% in the response surface method to within 2.2%. This study provides a high-precision parameterization method for DEM modeling of cohesive soil, offering references for establishing DEM simulations of loaders scraping cohesive soil.

### Homing through Reinforcement Learning

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Homing and navigation are fundamental behaviors in biological systems that enable agents to reliably reach a target under uncertainty. We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to model adaptive homing in continuous two-dimensional domain. In this framework, the agent's state is given by its angular deviation from home, actions correspond to alignment or stochastic reorientation, and learning is driven by a radial-distance-based cost that penalizes motion away from the target. For a single self-propelled agent moving with constant speed, we find that the mean homing time $\langle T_{\mathrm{home}} \rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the rotational diffusion strength $D_r$, with an optimal noise level $D_r^{*}$, revealing a subtle interplay between exploration and goal-directed correction. Extending to two agents with soft repulsion, one agent consistently reaches home faster than the other, while in multi-agents system, repulsion ensures separation and the fastest agent becomes progressively faster as group size increases. Finally comparing the mean homing time $\langle T_{\mathrm{home}} \rangle$ of an Active Brownian Particle (ABP) and RL agent over an identical range of $D_r$, we find that RL trajectories are shorter, less noisy, and consistently faster. Our results show that cost-driven learning, stochastic reorientation, and inter-agent interactions enable efficient adaptive navigation, linking individual and collective homing. This reinforcement learning framework captures key biological features such as feedback-based route learning, randomness to escape unfavorable orientations, and mutual coordination.

In this paper, we present a coarse-grained model of DNA based on the soft ellipsoid contact potential (ECP) to evaluate the base pairing interaction properly. We extend the ellipsoid contact like potential model (ECP), suitably modified and used previously by our group to model lipid bilayer phases with considerable success. This potential is used for base-base interactions, along with other potentials to capture bending, dihedral and solvent effects. The model shows a phase transition during hybridization and is able to reproduce the experimental melting curves with sufficient adequacy. Thermodynamical, along with conformational characteristics and structural properties of our model are studied in detail.

### Emergence of Superintelligence from Collective Near-Critical Dynamics in Reentrant Neural Fields

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Superintelligence is commonly envisioned as a quantitative extrapolation of human cognitive abilities driven by scale and computational power. Here we show that qualitative transitions in intelligence instead arise as dynamical phase transitions governed by collective critical dynamics. Building on a unified dynamical field-theoretic framework for cognition, we demonstrate that progressive collective coupling generated by reentrant mixing drives the system toward an infrared critical regime in which an extensive band of slow collective modes emerges. This spectral condensation reorganizes cognitive dynamics from localized relaxation to coherent motion along emergent low-dimensional manifolds. Through numerical analysis of the time-scale density of states, we identify robust power-law scaling of collective relaxation rates with well-defined critical exponents, placing the system within the universality class of self-organized critical many-body dynamics. Criticality alone would generically lead to instability. We further show that homeostatic regulation introduces a gapped stabilizing direction that protects the collective critical sector, yielding a dynamically maintained meta-stable infrared phase in which long-lived inference trajectories persist without collapse. The coexistence of scale-free collective dynamics and global stabilization defines a protected sector-critical regime in which coherence and internal flexibility coexist. Superintelligence therefore corresponds to a distinct dynamical stability class--a self-organized critical phase embedded within a stabilized cognitive manifold--rather than a smooth quantitative continuation of existing cognitive systems.

### Shear-Induced Collective Shape Oscillations in Dense Soft Suspensions

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Dense suspensions of deformable particles can exhibit rich nonequilibrium dynamics arising from complex flow-structure coupling. Using a multi-phase field model, we show that steady shear drives an initially disordered, dense, soft suspension into a positionally and orientationally ordered state, within which particles undergo robust self-sustained shape oscillations. These oscillations originate from repeated T1 neighbor exchanges that force the ordered particle lattice to cyclically traverse different ordered configurations, coupling particle deformation to evolving lattice topology. By identifying the lattice angle as a key variable, we construct a minimal one-degree-of-freedom model that quantitatively captures the limit cycle oscillation. Because these mechanisms rely only on deformability, packing, and shear, they provide a generic route to collective time-dependent behavior in dense soft suspensions.

### Exact Stationary State of a $d$-dimensional Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Harmonic Potential
**Source:** arXiv

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We derive the exact nonequilibrium steady state of a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in $d$ dimensions confined in an isotropic harmonic trap $V(\mathbf r)=μr^{2}/2$, with $r=\|\mathbf r\|$. Rotational invariance reduces the problem to the stationary single-coordinate marginal $p_X(x)$, from which the radial distribution $p_R(r)$ and the full joint stationary density follow by explicit integral transforms. We first focus on a generalized trapped RTP in one dimension, where post-tumble velocities are drawn from an arbitrary distribution $W(v)$. Using a Kesten-type recursion, we represent its stationary position in terms of a stick-breaking (or Dirichlet) process, yielding closed-form expressions for its distribution and its moments. Specializing $W(v)$ to the projected velocity law of an isotropic RTP, we reconstruct $p_R(r)$ and the full joint distribution of all the coordinates in $d=1,2,3$. In $d=1$ and $d=2$, the radial law simplifies to a beta distribution, while in $d=3$, we derive closed-form expressions for $p_R(r)$ and the stationary joint distribution $P(x,y,z)$, which differ from a beta distribution. In all cases, we characterize a persistence-controlled shape transition at the turning surface $r=v_0/μ$, where $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed. We further include thermal noise characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D>0$, showing that the stationary law is a Gaussian convolution of the $D=0$ result, which regularizes turning-point singularities and controls the crossover between persistence- and diffusion-dominated regimes as $D \to 0$ and $D \to \infty$ respectively. All analytical predictions are systematically validated against numerical simulations.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
A green transition in aviation requires a drastic upscaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The power-to-liquid process for the production of CO2-neutral jet fuel via electricity, called e-SAF, directly replaces fossil jet fuel without having to change infrastructure, aeroplanes, or jet-engines. The process combines green hydrogen with industrial exhaust gas, or captured carbon dioxide, in a circular economy concept. A key element of the e-SAF production plant is the reactor where syngas is produced. Traditional reactors use catalytic technology, which faces severe challenges due to the reduced performance over time because of catalyst degradation, clogging, and breakup due to embrittlement. A high-potential alternative is the catalyst-free reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reactor concept.   The primary aim of this paper is to investigate the fundamental aspects of the catalyst-free RWGS process, such as reaction kinetics and the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. The secondary aim is to identify how a typical combustion subgrid scale models for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) perform when the chemical reactions are endothermic, in contrast to the strong endothermicity associated with classical combustion.   It is found that even small traces of O2 in the CO2 stream can significantly increase the production rate of CO. This is attributed to the increased pool of OH. The effect is strongest at atmospheric pressure and less pronounced at higher pressure. By using the temporal jet framework to study turbulence-chemistry interactions, an algebraic equation for the prediction of the CO conversion time in a turbulent flow as a function of Damkohler number and chemical timescale is employed. Finally, it is concluded that the PaSR LES subgrid model designed for combustion reactions perform well also for the endothermic reverse water-gas-shift reaction.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Lysine (Lys/K) residues serve as major hubs for post-translational modifications (PTMs) owing to the chemical versatility of their ε-amino groups, giving rise to diverse regulatory functions. Accurate and efficient identification of modified lysine residues therefore requires computational models that can effectively capture both sequence and structural information while minimizing domain-specific feature engineering. In this study, we propose a unified deep learning framework for lysine PTM site identification that integrates sequence representations derived from a protein language model with atom-level three-dimensional structural features. This framework can be consistently applied to multiple lysine PTM types using a shared modeling strategy. As an application, we used the model to predict potential PTM site on human C-type lectin domain family 12 member A (hCLEC12A) and evaluated their functional relevance through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations indicate that the predicted lysine residues influence the stability and binding behavior of the hCLEC12A-antibody 50C1 complex. Overall, this work presents an integrative computational framework for lysine PTM site mining and functional analysis.

### Quo vadis biophotonics? Wearing serendipity and slow science as a badge of pride, and embracing biology

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
This article is a reflection on the themes of the Faraday Discussion meeting on "Biological and bio-inspired optics" held from 20 to 22 July 2020. It is a personal perspective on the nature of this field as a broad and interdisciplinary field that has led to a sound understanding of the material properties of biological nanostructured and optical materials. The article describes how the nature of the field and the themes of the conference are reflected in particular in work on the 3D bicontinuous biophotonic nanostructures known as single gyroids and in bicontinuous structures more broadly. Such single gyroid materials are found for example in the butterfly Thecla opisena, where the questions of biophotonic response, of bio-inspired optics, of the relationship between structure and function, and of the relationship between natural and synthetic realisations are closely interlinked. This multitude of facets of research on single gyroid structures reflects the beauty of the broader field of biophotonics, namely as a field that lives through embracing the serendipitous discovery of the biophotonic marvels that nature offers to us as seeds for in-depth analysis and understanding. The meandering nature of its discoveries, and the need to accept the slowness that comes from exploration of intellectually new or foreign territory, mean that the field shares some traits with biological evolution itself. Looking into the future, I consider that a closer engagement with living tissue and with the biological questions of function and formation, rather than with the materials science of biological materials, will help ensure the continuing great success of this field.

### Mixing properties of bi-disperse ellipsoid assemblies: Mean-field behaviour in a granular matter experiment

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The structure and spatial statistical properties of amorphous ellipsoid assemblies have profound scientific and industrial significance in many systems, from cell assays to granular materials. This paper uses a fundamental theoretical relationship for mixture distributions to explain the observations of an extensive X-ray computed tomography study of granular ellipsoidal packings. We study a size-bi-disperse mixture of two types of ellipsoids of revolutions that have the same aspect ratio of alpha approximately equal to 0.57 and differ in size, by about 10% in linear dimension, and compare these to mono-disperse systems of ellipsoids with the same aspect ratio. Jammed configurations with a range of packing densities are achieved by employing different tapping protocols. We numerically interrogate the final packing configurations by analyses of the local packing fraction distributions calculated from the Voronoi diagrams. Our main finding is that the bi-disperse ellipsoidal packings studied here can be interpreted as a mixture of two uncorrelated mono-disperse packings, insensitive to the compaction protocol. Our results are consolidated by showing that the local packing fraction shows no correlation beyond their first shell of neighbours in the binary mixtures. We propose a model of uncorrelated binary mixture distribution that describes the observed experimental data with high accuracy. This analysis framework will enable future studies to test whether the observed mean-field behaviour is specific to the particular granular system or the specific parameter values studied here or if it is observed more broadly in other bi-disperse non-spherical particle systems.

### Constitutive flow law for hydrogel granular rafts near the brittle-ductile transition

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Spatially varying flow laws have been identified in dry granular flow, yet their applicability to unjammed suspensions remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the quasistatic suspension flow combines dry granular rheology with nonlocal effects in the shear band and damped viscous flow in the outer creep region. Through rotary shear experiments on a hydrogel granular raft, we observe that the flow decays from the interface in the quasistatic regime, where the particles remain mobile even below the yield stress. These findings suggest the universal flow law across the transition between jammed/brittle granular behavior and unjammed/ductile viscous flow.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Disordered proteins are challenging targets for drug discovery because they lack well-defined binding pockets. Although small molecules can form relatively stable complexes with disordered proteins, the highly dynamic nature of these proteins complicates the understanding of their binding mechanism. To address this problem, we analyze the binding of the small molecule 10074-G5 to A{beta}42, which results in the formation of a disordered complex. We describe the binding mechanism in terms of binding paths, which are stochastic trajectories along which small molecule diffuse across disordered protein surfaces, forming transient contacts with overlapping groups of residues. To identify these binding paths, we define them as realizations of a stochastic process defined by a Markov State Model (MSM). The MSM is built from distinct states of the disordered complex and their corresponding transition probabilities, enabling both the dynamic mapping of binding hotspots and targetable regions where static pockets cannot be defined-extending the notion of binding pockets to disordered systems - and the quantitative calculation of binding affinities. The visualization of the MSM via knowledge graphs provides an intuitive representation of the binding paths. We further validated this approach across four additional systems, comprising C-terminal -synuclein with three distinct small-molecule binders, and the full-length peptide (140 residues) with binder fasudil. By generalizing the concept of static binding pockets to dynamic binding paths, our approach rationalizes small-molecule recognition by disordered proteins and establishes a framework for identifying druggable regions on systems that were previously considered intractable, providing insights for future drug design programs.

### Combining experiments and simulations to study the impact of multiple phosphorylations at the AT8 epitope of the Tau protein

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP) Tau is, under a hyperphosphorylated form, one of the molecular hallmarks of Alzheimers disease. This abnormal phosphorylation induces both a functional loss to regulate microtubule assembly and the formation of intraneuronal fibrillar inclusions. Notably, phosphorylation sites recognized by the AT8 antibody are particularly relevant in the development of Alzheimers disease. The main objective of this work is to understand how AT8 phosphorylation site affects the conformation and dynamics of Tau protein as early steps in Tau pathological transformation. We engineered an alanine Tau mutant to target specific phosphorylation sites restricted to the AT8 epitope, for which we generated two distinct phosphorylation states differing by the number of phosphosites. The combination of Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Analytical UltraCentrifugation (AUC) and pCALVADOS (a forcefield based on CALVADOS 2 with phosphorylation-specific parameters) allowed us to determine that both alanine mutation and phosphorylation on the AT8 epitope do not significantly change the hydrodynamic radius of the conformational ensemble. Our calculations of Local Curvatures and Local Flexibilities corroborated by cw EPR experimental data indicated that the mutations for selective phosphorylation did not modify Taus global dynamics. Nevertheless, simulations revealed that local stiffening and extension at the AT8 epitope scale with the extent of phosphorylation. Interestingly, phosphorylation does not just affect the immediate AT8 area but leads to distant contact losses, directed towards the N-terminus, potentially influencing Taus function. The study paves the way for future research on Taus structure-function-dynamics relationship and the role of phosphorylation in neurodegenerative diseases.  Statement of significanceWe combined experimental and simulation approaches to investigate the role of Tau site-specific protein phosphorylation at the AT8 epitope, which is implicated in Tau transformation associated with Alzheimers disease. We demonstrated that while phosphorylation does not significantly alter the overall size of Tau, it induces local structural changes at the AT8 epitope and long-range contact losses. These findings suggest a potential mechanism in which specific phosphorylation could modulate Taus interactions and function, contributing to neurodegeneration. Combining experimental studies with the pCALVADOS model, we provided a robust approach for future studies on Taus structure-function-dynamics and more generally for studying intrinsically disordered proteins and the impact of post-translational modifications on their conformational ensembles.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Optically addressable spin systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, have been widely studied for quantum sensing applications. In this work, we demonstrate that certain flavoproteins -- specifically cryptochrome and iLOV -- which generate spin correlated radical pairs upon optical excitation, also exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Remarkably, the iLOV protein, commonly used in cellular imaging, displays ODMR contrast approaching 50%. We present initial applications including widefield magnetic field sensing and spatial modulation of photoluminescence using radiofrequency pulses and magnetic field gradients. Our results establish radical pairs in proteins as a novel platform for optically addressable spin systems, offering the key advantages of molecular designability and genetic encodability. Moreover, due to the spin-selective nature of radical pair chemistry, the results lay the groundwork for future radiofrequency-based manipulation of biological systems.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Super-resolution microscopy with DNA-fluorophore labels is primed for multi-target imaging of cell biological samples. However, direct interaction with the sample is required to exchange or add DNA-fluorophore labels in each imaging round, which can impair the accuracy of the imaging data at the nanometer scale. To bypass this requirement, we introduce a wash-free method that employs DNA oligonucleotides equipped with photocaging groups. Irradiation with light removes these photo-modulatable groups and changes the hybridization properties of DNA labels, enabling light-modulated targeting. We demonstrate this concept by imaging various cellular targets with confocal microscopy, single-molecule localization microscopy, and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Coordinated forelimb actions, such as reaching and grasping, rely on motor commands that span a spectrum from abstract target selection to detailed instantaneous muscle control. The sensorimotor cortex is central to controlling these complex movements, yet how the detailed command signals are distributed across its numerous subregions remains unclear. In particular, in mice, it is unknown if the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices represent low-level joint angle details in addition to high-level signals like movement direction. Here, we combine high-quality markerless tracking and two-photon imaging during a reach-to-grasp task to quantify movement-related activity in the mouse forelimb M1 (M1-fl) and forelimb S1 (S1-fl). Linear decoding models reveal a strong representation of proximal and distal joint angles in both areas, and both areas support joint angle decoding with comparable fidelity. Despite shared low-level encoding, the time course of high-level target-specific information varied across areas. M1-fl exhibited early onset and sustained encoding of target-specific signals, while S1-fl was more transiently modulated around lift onset. These results reveal both shared and unique contributions of M1-fl and S1-fl to reaching and grasping, implicating a more distributed cortical circuit for mouse forelimb control than has been previously considered.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Sectioning techniques based on patterned illumination have been widely used to obtain well-contrasted images of thick samples using widefield imaging setups. While their application to fluorescence microscopy has been extensively demonstrated and studied, their application to reflection imaging is scarcer and their performance has only been partly characterized. In this paper, we study numerically and analytically two such sectioning techniques, line confocal (LC) and structured illumination (SI), in the context of their application to reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM), an imaging technique widely use in soft matter and biophysics studies to monitor object-surface interactions, or quantify surface functionalization. Our derivation, however, should provide insight into their use with other reflection methods such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or scanning laser ophtalmoscope (SLO). We derive approximate analytical equations to relate the performance of sectioning to the optical setup parameters, allowing straightforward understanding of their influence on the achieved image intensity and depth of focus, and we systematically compare our prediction with experimental data. Finally, we quantify the precision and accuracy of each method in typical practical cases, providing guidelines to choose the most appropriate (LC, SI, or a simple background subtraction on a widefield image) for the sample under study.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Neuronal energy regulation is increasingly recognized as a critical factor underlying brain functions and their pathological alterations, yet the metabolic dynamics that accompany cognitive processes remain poorly understood. As a label-free and minimally invasive technique, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of coenzymes NADH and NADPH (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H) offers the possibility to resolve cellular metabolic profiles with high spatial precision. However, NAD(P)H FLIM’s capacity to detect subtle variations in neuronal metabolism has not been demonstrated. In this study, we applied NAD(P)H FLIM to map the metabolic profiles of <i>Drosophila</i> neurons in vivo across multiple scales, focusing on the primary centers for associative memory: the mushroom bodies (MBs). At a broad scale, we obtained an overview of the metabolic signatures of the main brain tissue and identified a marked difference between neuropil and cortex areas. At a finer scale, our findings revealed notable heterogeneity in the basal metabolic profiles of distinct MB neuron subtypes. Measurements performed after associative olfactory learning also uncovered a low-magnitude subtype-specific metabolic shift associated with memory formation, suggesting the utility of NAD(P)H FLIM in detecting physiology-driven changes linked to brain function. These results establish a promising framework for studying the spatial heterogeneities and the dynamics of cerebral energy metabolism in vivo.

Researchers have characterized the structural framework of the chloroplast TOC (Translocon at the Outer envelope membrane of Chloroplasts) complex, but how this machinery orchestrates preprotein recognition and translocation at the molecular level remains unclear. Toc34, a membrane-anchored GTPase receptor within the TOC complex, plays a central regulatory role through its ability to oligomerize in a nucleotide-reversible, substrate-dependent manner. To investigate the dynamic behavior of Toc34, we employed single-molecule photobleaching, Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), and chemical crosslinking to examine its oligomeric states under various conditions.

Mapping protein conformations into a space of fold topologies offers an unprecedented perspective on the long-standing protein folding problem. In this study, we apply circuit topology to investigate the folding landscape of both stably folded and intrinsically disordered proteins. This topological approach quantifies intra-chain contact arrangements within a polypeptide chain. We demonstrate that ordered and disordered proteins can be distinguished by their topological organization, and that a topology-based model can predict chain compaction and folding state. Furthermore, topology relates to folding and unfolding kinetics and thermodynamics. These findings establish topology as a fundamental concept for understanding protein folding and disorder.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that self-assemble from the protein tubulin, a heterodimer of α-tubulin and β-tubulin, and are important for cell mechanics, migration, and division. Much work has focused on how the nucleotide state of β-tubulin regulates the structure and dynamics of microtubules. In contrast, less is known about the structure and function of the C-terminal tails (CTTs) of α- and β-tubulin which are thought to freely protrude from the surface of the microtubule. To study the CTT of α-tubulin, we developed three different biosensors that bind the tyrosinated α-tubulin CTT (Y-αCTT). Surprisingly, live imaging of the probes indicates that the Y-αCTT is minimally accessible along the microtubule lattice under normal cellular conditions. Lattice binding of the Y-αCTT probes can be increased by three different ways of changing the tubulin conformational state: the drug Taxol, expression of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that recognize or promote an expanded tubulin conformation, or expression of tubulin that cannot hydrolyze GTP. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Y-αCTT undergoes numerous transient interactions with the bodies of α-tubulin and β-tubulin in the lattice, and that the frequency of these interactions is regulated by the tubulin nucleotide state. These findings suggest that accessibility of the Y-αCTT is locally governed by nucleotide- and MAP-dependent conformational changes to tubulin subunits within the microtubule lattice.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The mitotic spindle is a biomechanical structure whose length must be precisely controlled to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. The treadmilling of microtubules towards centrosomes, termed poleward flux, is involved in spindle length control. However, poleward flux has been shown to be both inversely and directly proportional to spindle length, a contradiction that remains unexplained by current mechanisms. Here we introduce a model which demonstrates that length-dependent regulation at both microtubule ends allows plus- and minus-end dynamics to synchronize with one another, enabling pathways of poleward flux-based spindle length control which can rectify previous results. Moreover, our model predicts that spindle length and poleward flux can vary independently via simultaneous perturbations at both microtubule ends, which we experimentally validate with combinations of KIF18A, KIF2A, and KATNB1 depletions in human cells. Our results thus resolve a longstanding paradox and provide mechanistic insight into the reciprocal control of spindle length and poleward flux.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
As high-performance computing provides the ability to generate and analyze ever larger simulation trajectories, the challenges in learning, applying, and sharing the best analytical practices become more salient. Extracting reproducible scientific insights from simulation requires a thorough understanding of many computing topics unrelated to the molecular systems being modeled and simulated. While the rapid development of the technologies used for analysis makes previously impossible studies into routine work, the growing repertoire of software combined with the specificity of the ecosystems that they rely on can easily break the programs used in older studies. In this work, we present ST-Analyzer, a simulation trajectory analysis suite with command-line (CLI) and graphical (GUI) user interfaces. ST-Analyzer is distributed freely as an open-source conda-forge package with support for macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2). Besides facilitating several common analysis tasks, the GUI shows users the exact commands necessary to repeat the same tasks on the command-line. We demonstrate ST-Analyzers capabilities by reproducing several results from previously published simulation studies on the lipid parameters of heterogeneous biomembranes and the behavior of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-antibody complex. We expect ST-Analyzer to be useful to experts for quickly setting up common analysis tasks and to nonexperts as a guided introduction to simulation analysis using both GUI and CLI. ST-Analyzer is freely available at https://github.com/nk53/stanalyzer.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Histone trimethylation on the tail residue H3K9 of nucleosomes is a hallmark of constitutive heterochromatin. The mechanism how this mark is maintained over cell division cycles remains a topic of ongoing debate. The recent formulation of the polymer-assisted condensation (PAC) scenario, through which a stable droplet condensate can form as a reaction container for methylation reactions, has offered a novel approach to answer this longstanding question. In this letter we develop a kinetic proofreading argument for histone tail methylation which builds on the PAC model and yields support to the idea that liquid-liquid phase separation underlies the reconstitution of heterochromatin over cell division cycles.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
1The formation of protein amyloid fibrils in the brain is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer diseases and Parkinson diseases. Amyloid fibrils are highly ordered aggregates in which proteins folded in two-dimensional layers stack along one axis to form elongated linear assemblies. The specific conformations adopted by the proteins within each layer of the amyloid correlates with the pathology. Furthermore, their spreading and templating competency relies on strict in register packing of the folded proteins along the fibril growing axis. There is a need for tools to characterize not only the protein fold across the fibril cross section but also the spatial ordering of the proteins stacked along the amyloid fibril axis. We present an approach based on double electron electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER) using singly labelled tau protein assembled in amyloid fibrils that can deliver an apparent dimensionality of the supramolecular organization of tau fibrils. The parameters of the DEER background function can be used to assess the amyloid core location and packing order, and track time-resolved formation of aggregation intermediates. Showcasing the method on tau, we demonstrate that heparin-induced tau fibrils are mispacked while seeded aggregation can template amyloid fibrils with a higher packing order. This study benchmarks a new method that will provide critical structural insights into amyloid assemblies.

Two closely homologous channelrhodopsins from Hyphochytrium catenoides, known as HcKCR1 (kalium channelrhodopsin 1) and HcCCR (cation channelrhodopsin), exhibit >100 times different K+/Na+ relative permeabilities and are emerging optogenetic tools for controlling neurons and cardiomyocytes. Key residue motifs and trimeric organization relate them structurally to bacteriorhodopsin-like cation channelrhodopsins (BCCRs). Here, we demonstrate that they utilize a specific gating mechanism previously suggested for the earlier-discovered BCCR from cryptophytes.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Hearing and balance rely on the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into an electrical signal, a process known as mechanosensory transduction (MT). In vertebrates, this process is accomplished by a MT complex located in hair cells of the inner ear. While the past three decades of research have identified many subunits that are important for MT and revealed interactions between these subunits, the composition and organization of a functional complex remain unknown. The major challenge associated with studying the MT complex is its extremely low abundance in hair cells; current estimates of MT complex quantity range from 3-60 attomoles per cochlea or utricle, well below the detection limit of most biochemical assays used to characterize macromolecular complexes.

### Antibody Fc receptor CD16a mediates natural killer cell activation via mechanotransduction of piconewton forces

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Natural Killer(NK) cells eliminate target cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity(ADCC), initiated by CD16a(Fc{gamma}RIIIa) recognizing the Fc region of antibodies bound to the target cell surface. While the recognition is considered to be driven by CD16a-Fc binding avidity, it fails to explain why Fc multimers inhibit ADCC rather than trigger it. Here, we reveal that CD16a transduces piconewton forces, and acts as a mechanosensor to facilitate NK activation. We demonstrate that CD16a force and the actin foci formation associated with it are essential for the phosphorylation of mechanosensitive adaptor Cas-L and signaling adaptor LAT, reshaping NK cell cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling. Our findings show that NK activation is an intricate process that integrates both biochemical and biophysical information, and provides new mechanistic insight for immunoengineering.

### From Connectivity to Rupture: A Coarse-Grained Stochastic Network Dynamics Approach to Polymer Network Mechanics
**Source:** arXiv
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Authors:** Shaswat Mohanty, Wei Cai
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08089v1
<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We introduce a coarse-grained stochastic network dynamics (CGSND) framework for modeling deformation and rupture in polymer networks. The method replaces explicit molecular dynamics (MD) or coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) with network-level evolution rules while retaining chain entropic elasticity and force-controlled bond failure. Under uniaxial loading, CGSND reproduces the characteristic nonlinear stress--stretch response of elastomeric networks, including a well-defined ultimate tensile strength and post-peak softening due to progressive bond rupture. Comparison with coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations shows that CGSND captures the qualitative form of the stress response and the onset of catastrophic damage despite its rate-independent formulation. Analysis of rupture kinetics reveals a pronounced peak in the bond-breaking hazard rate near the ultimate tensile strength in both approaches. In addition, the distribution of broken segment lengths remains statistically indistinguishable from the initial network, indicating that rupture is not biased toward short or long chains. Finally, the evolution of the Gini coefficient of bond force magnitudes reveals strong force localization preceding failure. These results demonstrate that CGSND provides a computationally efficient and physically interpretable framework for connecting force localization and rupture kinetics to macroscopic failure in polymer networks.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We develop a continuum-statistical framework for colloidal dynamics to first order in the applied forces, based on the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and a reassessment of the conditions under which kinematic reversibility emerges in continuum mechanics. The theory recovers known results for buoyancy, phoretic motion, and active swimming, and extends them to include the effect of advective transport and hydrostatic many-body interactions through the colloidal osmotic pressure. The resulting formulation is consistent with Onsager's theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, thus providing a unified perspective on reciprocal relations in colloidal transport.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Collective motion in fish schools exemplifies emergent self-organization in active matter systems, yet computational tools for simulating and analyzing these dynamics remain fragmented across research groups. We present dewi-kadita, an open-source Python library implementing the three-dimensional Couzin zone-based model with comprehensive entropy diagnostics tailored for marine collective behavior research. The library introduces seven information-theoretic metrics -- school cohesion entropy, polarization entropy, depth stratification entropy, angular momentum entropy, nearest-neighbor entropy, velocity correlation entropy, and school shape entropy -- that characterize distinct organizational features inaccessible to classical order parameters. These metrics combine into an Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) providing a single scalar measure of collective disorder. Validation across four canonical configurations (swarm, torus, dynamic parallel, highly parallel) confirms correct reproduction of known phase behaviors: the swarm maintains disorder with polarization $P < 0.1$ and OSI $\approx 0.71$, while the highly parallel state achieves $P = 0.998$ with OSI $= 0.24$ and velocity correlation entropy vanishing to zero. The entropy framework successfully discriminates the torus and dynamic parallel configurations that exhibit comparable order parameter magnitudes through different organizational mechanisms. Numba just-in-time (JIT) compilation accelerates pairwise interaction calculations by $10$--$100\times$, enabling simulations of $150$--$250$ agents over $1000$--$2000$ time steps within five minutes on standard workstation hardware. NetCDF4 output ensures interoperability with oceanographic analysis tools. The library addresses the need for standardized, reproducible infrastructure in collective behavior modeling analogous to established molecular dynamics codes.

### Fast Jacobi Spectral Methods and Closure Approximations for the Homogeneous FENE Model of Complex Fluids

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic (FENE) dumbbell model is a widely used mathematical model for complex fluids. Direct simulation of the FENE Fokker--Planck equation is computationally challenging due to high dimensionality and singularity of its potential. In this paper, we develop two fast Jacobi-Spherical Harmonic spectral methods for the spatially homogeneous FENE Fokker--Planck equation. These methods effectively resolve the singularity near the boundary by combining properly designed Jacobi polynomials with a weighted variational formulation. A semi-implicit backward differentiation formula of second-order (BDF2) is employed for time marching, and its energy stability is rigorously proved. The resulting linear algebraic system possesses a sparse structure and can be efficiently solved. Numerical results verify the spectral convergence and efficiency of the direct spectral solvers, establishing them as a reliable tool for generating reference solutions for challenging benchmark problems. Furthermore, to achieve an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we compare several closure approximation models, including the industry workhorse Peterlin approximation (FENE-P), the quasi-equilibrium approximation (FENE-QE), and a novel neural network implementation for FENE-QE proposed in this paper (FENE-QE-NN). Numerical experiments in extensional and shear flows demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods compared to traditional approaches.

### Bidirectional allosteric ligand regulation in a central glycolytic enzyme

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Allosteric regulation enables fine-tuned control of enzyme activity in response to cellular signals, yet its molecular basis often remains unclear. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK), the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is a paradigmatic, well-conserved system whose reaction kinetics conform to the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allostery. However, X-ray crystal structures of bacterial PFK orthologs in distinct ligand-bound states do not show the consistent, concerted structural rearrangements expected for classical "relaxed" and "tense" states, revealing a decades-long disconnect between structure and function. We resolve this paradox by integrating biophysical and computational approaches to show that activator and inhibitor binding to the same allosteric pocket differentially reweight the conformational ensemble of Escherichia coli PFK. Activator binding stabilizes conformational substates that preorganize the catalytic site, whereas inhibitor binding upweights apo-like, catalytically incompetent substates. These findings establish an ensemble-based mechanism for PFK regulation and provide an energetic framework for understanding the expanded allosteric architecture of higher PFK orthologs.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Dengue virus (DENV) is a global disease threat with tropical regions bearing the bulk of disease burden. Presence of four DENV serotypes with varying antigenicity has complicated development of effective, pan-serotype strategies for prevention and treatment of dengue disease. Here, we report single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of DENV in complex with three human-derived broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), revealing an antibody class which preferentially uses its heavy chain for potency and antigen recognition. These heavy chain-driven E-dimer recognizing (HEDR) bnAbs potently neutralize all DENV serotypes by binding to a quaternary epitope encompassing the critical fusion loop and conserved glycans on DENVs surface E-glycoprotein dimer. We also demonstrate the presence of capsule-shaped DENV, with HEDR antibodies binding such tubular morphologies in addition to spherical virions. Cryo-EM helical reconstructions of Fab-bound tubular virions from different DENV strains establishes that the pattern of E-glycoproteins helical arrangement is dependent solely on the virus strain. The structural data also demonstrate that binding of highly potent HEDR bnAb D14.F25.S02 causes distortion of DENV particles. Collectively, these results elucidate key features of HEDR bnAbs while illustrating the importance of eliciting immune responses that can neutralize diverse DENV morphologies.

### Results of a large scale study of the binding of 50 type IIinhibitors to 348 kinases: The role of protein reorganization

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Kinase family proteins constitute the second largest protein class targeted in drug development efforts, most prominently to treat cancer, but also several other diseases associated with kinase dysfunction. In this work we focus on type II kinase inhibitors which bind to the "classical" inactive conformation of the protein kinase catalytic domain where the DFG motif has a "DFG-out" orientation and the activation loop is folded. Many Tyrosine kinases (TKs) exhibit strong binding affinity with a wide spectrum of type II inhibitors while serine/threonine kinases (STKs) often bind more weakly. Recent work suggests this difference is largely due to differences in the folded to extended conformational equilibrium of the activation loop between TKs vs. STKs. The binding affinity of a type II inhibitor to its kinase target can be decomposed into a sum of two contributions: (1) the free energy cost to reorganize the protein from the active to inactive state, and (2) the binding affinity of the type II inhibitor to the inactive kinase conformation. In previous work we used a Potts statistical energy potential based on sequence co-variation to thread sequences over ensembles of active and inactive kinase structures. The threading function was used to estimate the free energy cost to reorganize kinases from the active to classical inactive conformation, and we showed that this estimator is consistent with the results of molecular dynamics free energy simulations for a small set of STKs and TKs. In the current study, we analyze the results of a large-scale study of the binding affinities of 50 type II inhibitors to 348 kinases, of which the results for 16 of the 50 type II inhibitors were reported in an earlier study (the "Davis dataset"); the binding data for the remaining 34 type II inhibitors to the panel of 348 kinases were recently obtained (the "Schrodinger dataset"). We use the Potts statistical energy model to investigate the contribution of protein reorganization to the selectivity of the large kinase panel against the set of 50 type II inhibitors, and find that protein reorganization makes a significant contribution to the selectivity. The AUC of the receiver-operator characteristic curve is [~]0.8. We report the results of an internal "blind test", that shows how Potts threading energies can provide more accurate estimates of kinase selectivity than corresponding predictions using experimental results of small sample size. We discuss why two STK phylogenetic kinase families, STE and CMGC, appear to contain many outliers, and how to improve the ability to predict kinase selectivity with a more complete analysis of the kinase conformational landscape. We compare the performance of Potts threading for predicting binding properties of the large set of (50) Type II inhibitors to 348 kinases, with those of a sequence-based purely machine learning model, DeepDTAGen, a publicly available machine learning model that was trained on the complete Davis dataset, including both Type I and Type II kinase inhibitors. We observe that DeepDTAGen performs well on binding predictions for the 16 type II inhibitors in the Davis dataset, but performs poorly on binding predictions for the 34 type II inhibitors against 348 kinases in the Schrodinger dataset.

### Early-Enrichment Hit Discovery via Reversible-Work c(t) Estimation in Metadynamics (CTMD)

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Virtual screening for small-molecule binders is often limited by false positives from approximate scoring functions and rigid-receptor assumptions. These can be addressed downstream through accurate but expensive free energy calculations. At the same time, recent artificial-intelligence-based co-folding methods have been proposed that claim to achieve accuracy of free energy methods at much lower cost, but these have not yet delivered consistent improvements in early enrichment and can be confounded by memorization. Here we address this gap by introducing c(t)-based metadynamics (CTMD), a physics-based, high-throughput hit-triaging protocol tailored for early enrichment. CTMD uses the nonequilibrium reversible-work estimator c(t) introduced by Tiwary and Parrinello (Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2015 119 736), computed from a small number of short, independent well-tempered metadynamics trajectories, to rank binding stability without requiring converged binding free energies. Across diverse targets and chemotypes, CTMD provides robust early enrichment while remaining fast, transferable with minimal parameter tuning, and resistant to memorization-driven artifacts--underscoring both an immediately deployable physics-based alternative for screening. For these systems we show how co-folding, particularly Boltz-2, achieves enrichment directly proportional to similairty with training set, and more worrying, even in the presence of signficant modifications to active site. Given its simplicity of implementation, CTMD should thus be an "embarassingly" open-source, early enrichment method available for use by the broad pharma and academic community that sits right between approximate but fast docking or AI based co-folding methods, and more expensive but accurate free energy calculations, expected to lead to saving significant financial and human capital in drug discovery campaigns.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Many proteins biological functions rely on interconversions between multiple conformations occurring at micro- to millisecond ({micro}s-ms) timescales. A lack of standardized, large-scale experimental data has hindered obtaining a more predictive understanding of these motions. After curating >100 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxation datasets, we realized an observable for {micro}s-ms dynamics might be hiding in plain sight. Millisecond dynamics can cause NMR signals to broaden beyond detection, leaving some residues not assigned in the chemical shift datasets of [~]10,000 proteins deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB)1. We made the bold assumption that residues missing assignments are exchange-broadened due to {micro}s-ms motions and trained various deep learning models to predict missing assignments. Strikingly, these models also predict exchange measured via NMR relaxation experiments, indicative of {micro}s-ms dynamics. The best of these models, which we named Dyna-1, leverages an intermediate layer of the multimodal language model ESM-32. Notably, dynamics directly linked to biological function -- including enzyme catalysis and ligand binding -- are particularly well predicted by Dyna-1, which parallels our findings that residues experiencing {micro}s-ms exchange are more conserved. We anticipate the datasets and models presented here will be transformative in unlocking the common language of dynamics and function.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins are important for their function, allowing their heterogeneous conformational ensembles to rapidly reconfigure in response to binding partners or changes in solution conditions. However, the relation between sequence composition and chain dynamics has rarely been studied. Here, we characterize the dynamics of a set of 16 naturally occurring disordered regions of identical chain length but with highly diverse sequences. In spite of the strong variation of chain dimensions with sequence in this set inferred from single-molecule FRET, nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy yields chain reconfiguration times that are almost independent of sequence. This surprising observation contrasts with the slowdown in dynamics, attributed to internal friction, that has been observed in more compact disordered proteins. We investigated this effect with the aid of multi-microsecond, all-atom explicit-solvent simulations of all 16 disordered proteins. The simulations reproduce the experimental FRET efficiencies with near-quantitative accuracy, with explicit inclusion of the FRET dyes improving agreement with experiment while minimally perturbing the protein ensemble. Critically, the simulations also reproduce the lack of correlation between reconfiguration times and chain dimensions across the sequences and allow us to rationalize this observation as arising from two competing factors as the chains get more compact. The narrowing of end-to-end distance distributions and a concomitant reduction of the corresponding intrachain diffusion coefficients have opposite effects that end up resulting in only a small variation of reconfiguration times with chain dimensions. These compensating factors "buffer" the effect of sequence on linker dynamics, which may help to conserve function as sequences evolve.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that are considered the ancestors of the eukaryotic spliceosome. Unlike canonical group II introns that self-splice to generate linear exons and lariats, circularly permuted (CP) group II introns identified in various bacterial phyla perform back-splicing, resulting in the production of circular RNAs and branched products via branching pathway. Furthermore, CP introns may switch to a hydrolysis pathway resulting in distinct products to differentially regulate retrotransposition. In this study, we present biochemical data and high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a CP group II intron from Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 (Cte 1), allowing mechanistic dissection of the switch from the branching pathway to the hydrolysis pathway, and enabling reconstruction of both steps of the hydrolysis pathway. The structures reveal that CP group II intron undergoes the hydrolysis pathway upon mutations of the branch point or splice sites (SS) due to rearrangements in the active site. Here, the branching nucleotide in domain D6 is retracted from its catalytically competent conformation, giving way to the nucleophilic water molecule to attack the 5' splice site. Furthermore, we visualized the intermediates of the second splicing step, which reveal the movement of domain D6 out of the way for the 3'-splicing to occur, closely resembling the second-step structures of the branching pathway. Finally, our structures provide direct evidence for domains D1-D3 acting as a scaffold in group II introns. Together, these findings visualize the complete hydrolysis pathway and offer a new strategy to engineer CP group II introns for circular RNA production, with potential applications in both basic research and therapeutic development.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are biomolecular condensates composed of diverse RNAs and RNA-binding proteins that play essential roles in regulating multiple aspects of RNA biology. As complex biological systems, the condensate functions of RNP granules emerge from the higher-order kinetic assembly of individual molecules. Here, we develop an in vitro single-molecule approach--termed SMART (group single-molecule assay for ribonucleoprotein granules)--that enables direct and quantitative measurements of RNP granule assembly and disassembly kinetics across nanoscale to mesoscale regimes. Using SMART, we reveal that RNP granule assembly is strongly pathway dependent. In parallel, we develop a minimal two-state mathematical model that faithfully reproduces these kinetic behaviors. This model enables quantification of multivalent interaction timescales, reconstruction of the underlying free-energy landscape governing RNP granule dynamics, and demonstrates that this assembly process is intrinsically non-equilibrium. Understanding the condensate functions of RNP granules suggests new strategies for their rational manipulation in health and disease.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Nanoparticles (NP) are versatile materials with widespread applications across medicine and engineering. Despite rapid incorporation into drug delivery, therapeutics, and many more areas of research and development, there is a lack of robust characterization methods. Light scattering techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) use an ensemble-averaged approach to the characterization of nanoparticle size and electrophoretic mobility (EPM), leading to inaccuracies when applied to polydisperse or heterogeneous populations. To address this lack of single-nanoparticle characterization, this work applies 3D Single-Molecule Active Real-time Tracking (3D-SMART) to simultaneously determine NP size and EPM on a per-particle basis. Single-nanoparticle EPM is determined by using active feedback to "lock on" to a single particle and apply an oscillating electric field along one axis. A maximum likelihood approach is applied to extract the single-particle EPM from the oscillating nanoparticle position along the field-actuated axis, while mean squared displacement is used along the non-actuated axes to determine size. Unfunctionalized and carboxyl-functionalized polystyrene NPs are found to have unique EPM based on their individual size and surface characteristics, and it is demonstrated that single-nanoparticle EPM is a more precise tool for distinguishing unique NP preparations than diffusion alone, able to determine the charge number of individual NPs to an uncertainty of less than 30. This method also explored individual nanoparticle EPM in various ionic strengths (0.25-5 mM) and found decreased EPM as a function of increasing ionic strength, in agreement with results determined via bulk characterization methods. Finally, it is demonstrated that the electric field can be manipulated in real time in response to particle position, resulting in one-dimensional electrokinetic trapping. Critically, this new single-nanoparticle EPM determination and trapping method does not require microfluidics, opening the possibility for the exploration of single-nanoparticle EPM in live tissue and more comprehensive characterization of nanoparticles in biologically relevant environments.

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Metabolites are abundant in cells, where condensation of proteins and nucleic acids can organize cellular contents without membranes. Condensates form and dissolve dynamically in response to diverse cellular processes. Understanding condensate phase behavior using full phase diagrams is hampered by the sheer number of distinct molecular species involved. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce susceptibility, a dimensionless descriptor that quantifies dilute-phase responses to solute perturbations and enables direct comparison across condensates. We measure how three model condensates, assembled by distinct cohesive mechanisms, respond to amino acids, nucleotides, and a crowder. We find that these small molecules generically modulate condensate phase equilibria, with susceptibilities spanning over five orders of magnitude. These magnitudes reflect underlying molecular interactions, consistent with theoretical descriptions of condensation including Flory-Huggins and polyphasic linkage theories. We extend susceptibility to multicomponent perturbations by expressing the response as a weighted sum of individual solute perturbations. Applying these principles, we exploit enzymatic activity to induce condensation and modulate material properties. Our work establishes metabolites as generic modulators of biomolecular condensates with relevance to cellular physiology and provides a framework for programming condensates with desired phase and material properties.  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCells compartmentalize biochemistry using biomolecular condensates formed by phase separation. Although cells contain thousands of small molecules, little is known about their influence on condensation. In such complex mixtures, mapping full phase diagrams is infeasible because the required measurements scale exponentially with the number of components. Alternatively, we introduce susceptibility to characterize the system response about a working composition. Working with three distinct model condensates, we show that common metabolites generically modulate phase equilibria, consistent with theories of mass action and phase separation. We apply this framework to induce condensation and tune material properties using enzymatic reactions. Our work provides a framework for understanding and harnessing small molecules to regulate biomolecular condensation.

### A proton transfer mechanism in the malaria parasite lactate/H+ symporter reveals a channel-like transporter without conformational changes

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum relies on anaerobic glycolysis for energy during the intraerythrocytic stage, producing lactate and H+ that must be extruded via its formate-nitrite transporter (PfFNT) to prevent death by cytosolic acidification and swelling. Unlike bacterial homologues classified as channels, PfFNT mediates saturable lactate transport and was classified as a transporter, raising questions about its transport mechanism and what distinguishes channels from transporters. Here, we combine over 720 s of molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemical calculations, and transport assays in Xenopus laevis oocytes to characterize the transport cycle of PfFNT. We show a transport mechanism in which protonation of a central histidine (H230) enables lactate binding, and proton transfer from H230 to lactate is required to release the substrate as neutral lactic acid. This mechanism is supported by data indicating that neutral compounds such as lactamide do not enter the cavity, while anions like iodide, which are unlikely to protonate under physiological conditions, bind in the cavity but are not released and thus block lactate transport. As neither lactate nor lactic acid can diffuse passively through the protein, it is the requirement for proton transfer defines PfFNT as a lactate/H+ transporter rather than a channel. Notably, the PfFNT transport process occurs without significant protein conformational changes. Furthermore, our data indicates that under acidic conditions, small neutral molecules such as formic acid can passively diffuse through the protein. This suggests PfFNT challenges standard definitions of channels and transporters and differs from existing examples of channel-like transporters as it i) operates as a transporter without conformational changes and ii) can switch between transporter and channel modes within the same transport pathway.

### Unbend: Correction of local beam-induced sample motion in cryo-EM images using a 3D spline model

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
The exposure of frozen biological samples to the high-energy electron beam in a cryo-electron microscope commonly leads to beam-induced sample motion and distortions. Previously, we described Unblur, which is part of our cisTEM software to correct for beam-induced motion based on the alignment of full frames in a movie collected during the beam exposure (Grant et al., 2015). However, Unblur cannot accommodate motion due to more localized sample bending and distortions. Here, we present Unbend, extending Unblur by incorporating local motion correction using a three-dimensional cubic spline model. The 3D spline model is constructed using cubic B-splines along the exposure time axis, and bicubic B-splines within movie frames. Unbend is integrated into our cisTEM software with a new local motion visualization panel within the cisTEM graphical user interface. We processed movie frames from various in-situ sample types, including whole cells, lamellae, and cell lysates, to analyze motion behavior across different specimen types. To quantify the improvement in high-resolution signal, we utilized the 2D template matching method, which operates independently of the motion correction process, to search large ribosomal subunits from the motion-corrected micrographs. Overall, the signal-to-noise ratio of detected particles improved by 3-8% across different samples compared with full-frame aligned micrographs, while the number of detected target particles increased by up to [~]300%. The total and Von Mises equivalent strain shows a deformation scale of less than 1% in most of the samples, confirming that our model induces minimal additional distortion. Furthermore, we processed micrograph montages to study motion patterns across an entire sample, revealing considerable variance in distortion scale within the same sample, suggesting a complex underlying mechanism.
